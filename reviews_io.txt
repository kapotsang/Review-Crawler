AVOID**
I could not express enough how absolutely awful this company is.
I purchased from seller on ebay which cost me almost £200! I had returned some items in the same packaging as unwanted gift which the seller said was fine and provided me with a returns address (which was false! simon done this so the parcel would show as signed for. And then ebay would see it was not to the correct address)
This item was signed for by the office next door as UNDERU were not open on this day of delivery as I called up to check item was received and the line said office is closed
This company is causing me a lot of distress they promised me my refund and its been over a month.
They will not respond to any of my emails. I am being completely ignored. I have been extremely polite in all emails but now i am frustrated as i've been well and truly scammed.
I would seriously advise not to return anything to this company as YOU WILL NOT get your money back. They have the items and my money.
Please take advise as they now have my money and the items.
I don't want this to happen to anyone else. Simon was very nice at first trying to sell the products and get my money. But as soon as you send this money its game over.
Awful customer service by far worst i've ever received

I don’t understand how I can be refunded for only 1 item when this was all sent together.
I am owed £86.97.
I would seriously advise not to return anything to this company as they make out it was signed for by another company and you wont get your money back.
Please take advise as they now have my money and the items.

Ordered my item over a week ago and it did not get dispatched until 2 days ago when my item should have already been here. Pboned customer service and I was told it would be delivered 1st class and I am still waiting on my item. Will never use this website again. Disgraceful service.
”
“
Great service and arrived super fast.
”
“
great brands
”
“
Great service - would recommend - competitive prices
”
“
High quality service
”
“
YOU DON'T STOCK LARGER SIZES IN MEN'S UNDERWEAR. 41 & 42 INCH WAIST ARE NOT IN YOUR LISTINGS.
APART FROM THAT THE SERVICE IS GOOD.
”
“
My order came on time and fits perfect. I will be returning
”
“
Great selection of items and excellent communication and returns
I will purchase from again in the future
”
“
Great prompt service - would definitely use again.
”

I was really impressed with the level of service from UnderU.com.
The website was very easy to use and the delivery was very fast as i expected.
Unfortunately the goods i purchased were too big around the waist so i had to return them for a full refund but i will definitely be returning to shop at UnderU.com very soon.
”
“
Good product great price and really quick delivery. Very satisfied with my purchase!
”

I was very disappointed with Under U. They sent me the wrong item first time; I complained and received a quick and helpful email saying the correct item would be sent first class and I should keep the wrong one as a gesture of goodwill. The replacement parcel arrived the next day. So far so good. But the parcel contained the same wrong item. When I complained again I was told I had in fact been sent the right item both times. This was definitely not true - which led me to conclude not only that Under U doesn't really understand the range it sells but also that its customer service approach - telling the customer they are wrong rather than bothering to investigate whether it has made a mistake itself - is completely inappropriate. (The two different replies also suggest very poor consistency among its customer service staff). I will certainly never use them again and wouldn't recommend them to anyone else.

Good quality items albeit one of the pairs I received were marked with the box also damaged. It was re-covered in cling-film type material obviously a return.
”
“
Item still on delivery 9 days after dispatch going via surface mail not Air Mail as suggested on website.
”
“
Not very absorbent nor comfortable
”
“
Still waiting for purches to be deliver . Alredy more then 1 week. Very disappointed
”
“
one of the boxes was missing a pair of underwear
”
“
Good range of clothing and good pricing  but if you get your sizing wrong you have to pay to return your goods so probably wouldnt use again unless they changed it to free returns
”
“
Very poor delivery times even though it was on a reduced rate I still expected better delivery times it was only one pair of underwear and it took 4 days to get to me I normally have one certain product delivered to me once a month it weighs 5.4kilos it comes with free delivery and it is with me next day despite being the cheapest place to buy it in the country so overall very good product but very poor delivery times
”
“
When there came I opened them the first pair I got out they was a grease stain on it. As I was going on holiday the next day just took them .
”
“
Delivered slow but to be fair had wrong address but saying that still not received 10 % back for my troubles .nice people thou.
”
“
I shouldn't really have to pay to return faulty goods which is my last experience. Returns should be free with a postal label to include the cost of the postage and not just the return address. Service normally very good but need to mark down on that basis
”
“
Delivery was not free as stated
”
“
I orderd an item on the 18th of December as a gift I got no tracking order & still await it's delivery. This was ment to take 3-5 days it is now the 28th & no reply from my emails or calls
”
“
Really good service
”
“
Delivery was prompt and item as described. However the postage costs to return an item would prevent me from using again.
”
“
Swimming trunks delivered fast and just as ordered would use again.
”
“
UnderU.com is an easy website to use with a great array of products & at great prices i have bought products from the website on numerous occasions & have all been great quality products with great & prompt delivery will continue to buy for the forseable future.

“
Got my james tudor briefs great fit and superb quality would buy again
”
“
The ordering and delivery process was smooth and quick as it always seems to be with UnderU. I'm not that happy with the products though - I purchased 2 different triple packs of Armani briefs and trunks on a 20% off promo. There's something lacking and the sizing isn't great - I'm a large and Armani usually fit well but the cotton seems to have too much give and the trunks look a little 'saggy' by the end of the day.
”
“
Good service and great prices. Be aware that you have to pay for returns though. Ordered some t shirts in a couple of sizes and colours to try on at home. Ended up sending all back and cost £9.17 second class recorded post. A lot of money to pay to try a few t shirts on!
”
“
I still have not recieved my items which I purchased 9 days ago
”
“
wrong item sent 3 days without any contact emails ignored paypal case is opened (never pay directly with your credit card to them)
”
“
As ? have receive nothing yet may you please inform me where the parcel is?
I think it should have arrived by now.
When I do receive it you will have a very positive feedback. But till then please just let me know about the delay.
Thank you in advance.

I have not yet received the item I ordered. I only ordered it 3 days ago.
”
“
I will gladly provide a review but do you not think it would be best to wait until you've actually delivered the items ?!?
”
“
Your service and website have so far been good bit no better than other sites I have used.
”
“
I have not even received it yet ?!?!?

Ordered hugo boss socks as a gift but was sent Armani briefs instead I'm sure those who packed them wants their eyes looking at because it states in black and white socks!
