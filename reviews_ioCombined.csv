When trying to transfer funds into a bank account in my name I had the misfortune of being put through to the fraud team. Despite my having confirmed I am the account holder and am not under any duress to put through a payment I have some snotty nosed kid in a call center asking me why I'm transferring the money. At what point did Natwest turn into my mother? I refused to explain why I am moving these funds as, quite frankly, it's not of the banks business. Their duty of care to ensure they aren't liable for a scam is to ensure I am the account holder and am acting of my own volition, so for them to start questioning me as to why I'm making a transfer is unnecessary and intrusive. I have been a Natwest customer for over 30 years but this is unacceptable and will be closing my account.

Shockingly bad service at Leyland, lancashire branch. Rude arrogant staff who should know better having been there since the building was built. Despite banking a cheque for over 2k she then took my ¬£300 cheque for cash into a back room and was gone for over 5 minutes leaving me and numerous customers standing waiting. Was then questioned as to who's signature was on the cheque. Their mannerisms are appalling. Closure of Leyland is long overdue.

I never write a review as I don't have the time, but I have to agree with so many reviews here. 40 years a business customer and now they want to check every transaction meaning time wasted on calls rather than working on my business. They are making it very clear that they are not interested in loyal small business customers. Like many here, they are now doing periodic reviews acting like my accountant or the HMRC. Totally invasive all in the name of money laundering. They make you feel like a criminal when they are the biggest Ponzi scheme in the world. Unless you have debt with them they have no interest.

Natwest have FINALLY made us look to move to another bank. After 50 years with them they should be ashamed of how they treat there customers. No respect has been shown to us on trying to make an online payment they are rude and couldn‚Äôt care less.They ask customers to go paperless statements which obviously is good for the environment and we were told it would make no difference as we could have access to print them off. Doesn‚Äôt work if you want your name and address on the statement , no good if you want it as ID. after spending hours on hold and been told different answers we are still awaiting an electronic statement which takes 48 hrs not what you call quick and after two attempts we are still waiting for it. Many will say we stayed to long . Tomorrow is a new day for us to find a new bank and hopefully a better banking future. Nothing can be as bad Natwest

Had fraudulent activity on my account. Rang the fraud team and waited an hour for someone to pick up. Went through the transactions and thought all was sorted. Went to use the account only to find they had blocked it which left me stranded on a night out .Went online the next day and was told my account would be reinstated. Checked the next day and it wasnt. Went online again and was told to ring the fraud team as they were the only ones able to unblock it. rang the fraud team again answered all the security questions but couldn't remember where I had used chip and pin in the last 7 days. Told to either post (!!!) a copy of my passport or go into branch. So far it has taken me 5 days to try and sort this out. Going to the branch is a nightmare as there is one member of staff to help people with their issues . An absolute appalling bank,avoid ,avoid,avoid

After all, she says that I have to go to an agency to have my transfer approved from my personal to my business account!

The CTF managed by Natwest doesn't want to give our money back after holding for 18 years. Now my child is 18 years old and for more than 3 months I have been trying to get our hard earned money back but they are not willing to return the money. Today I was holding the phone for 1 hr 32 mins and 54 secs and then got fed up and disconnected. Their online portal doesnt work. So we don't know what is the balance in the account and how do we get back. There are lots of people having a similar review on Review Centte. Natwest has to somehow sort this problem out without any delay as we need our money back straightaway.
I complained to Natwest and gave all the details as required by them. Yesterday after checking with them about the status of my complaint. They said they have deleted it from their system and sent all the details to their CTF section, who have not bothered to contact us anyways. Somebody has to.take responsibility and sort this problem out. It is having a devastating effect on me and my child's physical and mental health. The situation is serious.
The indifference from Natwest is very disappointing. I am a customer of Natwest for more than 33 years.

Closed my account after 30 years as the bank refused to guarantee my safety around volatile, abusive male employees.
Male employees are very disrespectful and verbally abusive to senior citizens. Fahim refused to serve me because he didn't know how to cancel a direct debit. So I closed my savings account.
The next time I went in, Kamel screamed at me like a mentally ill person for no reason.
Male employees appear mentally unstable and liable to flip out any minute. I was afraid to go back and wrote to Natwet 5 x to ask whether they could guarantee my safety - they refused to do and sent me flowers instead!. The most inappropriate response ever. I closed my current account after 30 years.

I have been with Natwest since I was 15 I am now 63. When I had no or little money in my account they were great to me over the years. My daughter recently passed away and unfortunately I am her beneficiary. Now I have a substantial amount of money they have suddenly become unbelievable difficult to deal with. After all this time I am on the verge of closing my account. Money under the mattress might be a better option. Interest rates are negligible anyway and at least I won't have to deal with incompetent uncommunicative bank staff.

Nat West Bank UK decided to close my account due to Brexit because I am resident outside the UK. I had to transfer all my money out of the account before the closure date. They advised me to increase my daily limit in order to be able to transfer the money in a few days but then refused to release the first transfer payment for security issues (although they didn't contact me to tell me this or clarify it with me), I had to call them to see why there was a hold up. I was then told I needed to email proof that I wanted to transfer the money (which I did whilst still on the call). 2 days later, they still hadn't released the payment and to make it worse, they had completely locked me out of my own bank account, so I could no longer access anything, never mind transfer the remaining funds. I spent more than 2 hours on old over the course of half a day and twice they hung up on me before I had even given my name and another time in the middle of a call. 5 days later and the money has still not been transferred and they will close my account on Monday and then I will have to pay extra to get the money released on top of additional administrative expectations. They have handled this process in a hideous an unprofessional manner with little or no regard for customer assistance or care. I have been with this bank for over 30 years but I would advise anyone considering them as an option to go elsewhere. If you already bank with them - get out while the going is good. I am incredibly disappointed.

My 7 months pregnant daughter had to pay for her divorce of ¬£30,000. She had money in different accounts and arranged to pay all the money into Natwest and do the transaction to her solicitor. We went to the bank with ¬£10,000 cash, from a bond that she cashed in. She tried to pay cash in through machine, but it didn't work, meanwhile a member of staff called over from the other side of a screen, quite loudly, to pay small bundles in at a time. We gave up and went to the cashiers desk, my daughter was asked where she got the cash from, she told cashier it was a bond and the cashier asked why it wasn't paid direct into Natwest account.... Once money was paid into Natwest my daughter asked for all her money in the account to be transferred to solicitor, the cashier told her to go queue on the other side. She stood in queue for 8minutes (7months pregnant and upset to have to pay EX ¬£30,000) Cashier no.2 arrived and asked my daughter again , where she got the cash from that was just paid in? my daughter answered and also told her she had just told cashier no.1. Cashier then asked who are you paying? Why are your paying? and other questions, at which point my pregnant daughter burst into tears and explained she was getting a divorce etc. She was then subjected to more questions... Then had to stand whilst we waited for Cashier no.3 to authorise the payment..... Behind us had built up quite a queue all listening to my daughters divorce issues and listening to her cry her eyes out.
Not once did anyone offer her a seat or a private room.....
I understand security checks have to be made, but surely when someone is crying the staff need to be more sensitive and at least offer a private room to finish of the transaction and at least a seat for a 7months pregnant upset woman.

From starting the staff told that they have a customers and they do not have a time. Finally I spoken with them and I was thinking the problem is solve. No. They asking my daughter go home and do payment online. How she can do that without the machine card rider. We will lost the property because we do not have a chance to do the payment. We will lost the deposit too. One star is too much. When I come back to the UK I will close the account with them. We are with them more 20 years. Go to another bank.

I've been a business banking customer since I started my first business in 2014. There have been multiple issues which have this month come to a head.
In the time since 2014 Natwest have refused us an overdraft on all three occasions we took the time to try and apply through their convoluted system. During this time we have never had a loan, never defaulted on any payments, averaged between ¬£20k - ¬£48k turnover on a monthly basis (it's seasonal work) and run all of our utilities payments and PDQ machine takings and BACS payments through the account as well as operating our VAT account through Natwest. They did well from us in monthly fees and other additional transfer costs as we purchased from the US on many occasions.
Regardless, they seemed more than disinterested in offering us any sort of assistance in growing the business, which is disappointing and frustrating seeing as they like to promote themselves as the best bank for small businesses. I do not agree with them on this.
I have not once been able to talk to their small business representative, of which they have one person in the south west of the UK, at one point I was handed his mobile number after my frustrations became clear, he never returned a call, in 3 years. No one in branch (I tried in Chiswick where I opened the account, Bristol where the business operated from and Bath repeatedly) will discuss anything to do with small business bank accounts, other than letting you deposit cash or cheques, or take out cash and forgetting to assign references to transactions when requested, which may seem like a small error but is in-fact very important when book keeping and talking to HMRC. As any small business owner can attest to, keeping your book keeping as clear and informative as possible is a large step on the way to staying profitable.
We ended up staying with Natwest simply because I was too busy to do otherwise and it was synced with our Xero accounting and a 7-10 delay on reconciling the account would have been a difficult task to undertake during busy months.
After the lockdown affected our business ability to operate Natwest started asking us for all sorts of documents relating to our business structure, information that we did not have to provide previously but was now of utmost importance - list of directors, photo ID of directors, home address of directors, list of people with significant control, copies of DLA signed by our accountants, declaration of beneficial ownership.... We provided all of these and offered our own questions, such as why this was now necessary, why Natwest thought they had a right to our business details as they are just the bank that holds the money we have earned and what was their purpose for wanting these details. Every one of our questions went unanswered, the communication at Natwest to discuss these matters is worse than lacking it simply does not exist.
This month and without any notice or warning Natwest closed both my business current and VAT accounts, basically making it impossible for us to trade when we are legally allowed to do so again.
There is no one at the end of the phone at Natwest that can offer any assistance whatsoever with this matter. An email address does not exist, so there is conveniently no dated record of correspondence, I had to resort to (and I can't quite believe this) Facebook messenger to try and make contact, I received one reply which was deeply unhelpful and actually mostly consisted of more questions than answers, it has been two hours and I have not had an answer to my response.
I feel let down and left out to dry by the bank that I put my trust in, under their persuasion and apparent commitment to small business development. I can tell you now that this commitment they promote is a complete fabrication and the infrastructure does not exist within Natwest to help any small business grow or even stay afloat. Natwest have done more damage to us than I ever thought possible and they refuse to even discuss any of this with me.
Absolutely shocking how bad, destructive and disinterested in customer care this bank is.

After banking with Natwest for 30 years, I closed one account last year after being verbally abused and publicly humiliated by Fahim at the Streatham branch. The next time I ventured back 5 months later, I was again victimized and harassed by Kamel. I therefore tried to close my remaining account by mail as I don‚Äôt feel safe going into the branch but Natwest claimed my signature did not match. I therefore reasonably asked them to confirm I would be safe from harassment if I visited the branch to close the account ‚Äì I asked FOUR TIMES in writing and they were unable to give me the assurance. I will now simply withdraw the funds and let natwest waste their time sending me a monthly paper statement for an account with a zero balance.

Took out a secured business loan with NatWest to buy the freehold of my property three years ago. They did all the usual checks upon checks including my Passport, Driving licence and Utility bills.
Imagine my surprise to receive a letter from their 'Business Profile Team' on a letterhead with just their logo on and no 'NatWest'
name. Told me that they were doing a 'Business Profile' check on me to make sure everything was in accordance with the 'Financial Acts' etc and to 'Prevent Money Laundering, Crime, Evasion of Tax etc.' They asked me to send confidential documents to them via a link called 'Hooyu'. Now that sounds very 'Chinese' to me. We have been continuously told of 'fraudulent scams' and 'fraudulent activity'. So being worried, I called up my local 'Regional NatWest Business Centre' asking to speak to my 'Business Relationship Manager'. They said they had to take some 'security details' from me first. They asked me to provide my name, dob, name of business, how long I have been trading, the turnover, how many staff I employed, any other businesses I had, any overseas property I had, any other person who had 'authority' in the business etc. After I had given all the information, the guy told me they no longer have 'Business Relationship Managers' and all queries would be directed to a central line. When I told them about this 'Business Profile letter' and asked if it was 'real', the guy was very cagey and asked me to contact the number on the letter. I asked what it was about and he said to 'speak to the Business Profile team'.
When I called the number on the letter, the guy asked me the same questions, again, and unbelievably he said he couldn't find me on their 'system' !
Having taken out a big 'Business Loan' secured on my property, only three years earlier, and having provided my Passport, Driving Licence, Business Utility Bills to them in person to them to get the loan, this guy at the end of the phone said he couldn't find me !!!
The guy wanted to know how many times I had been out of the country, whether I had any businesses in any country, whether I had any properties in any country and how much I earned in the past twelve months.
I told him NatWest had all these personal and confidential details already but he still said he wanted me to to upload them onto 'Hooyu' and wanted me to send details of my accounts and a letter from my accountant. Otherwise, he would freeze my account and I wouldn't be able to pay in or withdraw my money and they would close my account if i didn't 'co-operate' !
The guy was extremely rude, unpleasant and threatening. How do you expect customers to remain with NatWest?
How can they say they can't find you on their 'system' when you have a large loan with them and with a direct debit paying them back monthly ?
I spent the following two days opening a new account with another bank. The new bank told me not to worry and they would sort everything out for me. They did that without any hassle. They transferred all the direct debits and standing orders over to the new account within three days.
Everything is great with the new bank and the 'service' is miles better than NatWest. Don't hesitate, guys ! change banks immediately, if NatWest continues to employ idiots to give you a hard time and make you out to be 'criminals', when you have done nothing wrong !

Past 3 years p60 and the last 11months payslips is still not enough for them they want more. 2 months of my time wasted
I've come to the conclusion natwest are discriminating against single people

DO NOT TRUST THEM
After banking with them for 5 years, i wanted to open a business account; Once everything was uploaded via their app, after few days, I've got a message that they will block my account! I DID NOTHING WRONG! NOTHING! Who in it's right mind will treat it's own customers in such a bad manner with no reason at all? No wonder that they've got 1-2 stars reviews all over the internet!

I visited NatWest bank ( Hounslow High Street branch) in December 2020 to withdraw ¬£3000 cash from the counter . Although ,I showed them a valid form of an ID ,they refused to give me my money and wanted to see an invoice or a receipt ; to proof why I am taking such a large amount of payment . Horrible bank .

This is my non 5 star review ever. After 40 years of very satisfactory in branch and on line service, I get this letter from the NatWest Accounts Closure Team that all my accounts with NatWest are being closed in 60 days. No explanation.
I have only once ever gone overdrawn, got a good cash flow and ¬£10,000 on account.
So I call up to find out if there is something I did wrong, see if I could rectify it, because I thought I have always been a good, satisfied client, contributing to the bank with a good cash flow, money on account and good word of mouth.
The polite answer on the phone is that the bank does not need to give any reason, she would put in an appeal. A few days later I get another letter from the Accounts Closure Team reconfirming closure.
So I find myself with the inconvenience of needing to transfer my accounts and payees to another bank and changing account details with all concerned making payments to me. Uugh.
I'm sorry, but after all my earlier praises, I find my faith broken and can no longer recommend this bank. Fortunately there is no shortage of other banks who welcomed me.

I've had a personal bank account with natwest for over 12 years then 4 years ago switch my business account to make things easier.
OMG WORST MISTAKE.......NOW DUE TO COVID I have been informed that Mr Craig Piper and his so called account review have a covert and strategic way of slowly putting black business owners out of business by profiling them and disabling them by removing business accounts from the app.
They asked me for information thats is very far fetch within the time constraints then remove access to my own hard earned money. Leaving me unable to pay staff, creditors and make 2020 the worse year yet RUINING Christmas whilst they are on leave.
I regret leaving Barclays.
Please I implore you guys switch to a different bank.
I spoke to mine and other accountants who has never heard of this in their in 25 year history.
They lost over 1 billion due to fraud in covid but why attach legitimate business owners.

"Account Closure Without Warning!","‚Äú
Stay away from them!!!
On December 9th I have received a letter saying that my account was closed. On that day I already did not have access to my online banking to make transfer arrangements for the money that is still sitting there. In other words I do not have access to my money!
I have called the team over the phone and went to a branch to get some help. On the phone they HANG UP ON ME! And in the branch all they say is for me to fill out a form to get my money transferred within 60 WORKING DAYS, which is by far not acceptable at all!
Since my account with Natwest is my main bank account, this is the only money I have, and Natwest REFUSES to release my money, which is a criminal delict.
But not only that: We are in the middle of a pandemic and Natwest forced me to go to their branch, putting me and an elderly person I live with, and who is having a condition, in risk.
Further, the elderly person I live with is my landlord. I will now not be able to pay my rest for the next 3 months, and the landlord will cancel my contract, accordingly.
Not to mention that it`s 10 days before ChrIstmas!
However, my case is by far not the only one. On Facebook and Trustpilot you can read about many Natwest customers whose account was closed WITHOUT ANY WARNING ‚Äì HOLDING THEIR MONEY.
I will need to inform the government about this incident. Further, I will have to take court action against you and contact the Daily Mail as well as BBC and Money Box. I will make this case public in any way possible!

FRAUDULENT BANK! STAY FAR AWAY!!!!!
Awful service/ staff hang up on you and talk over you constantly, not considerate of your situation that you can not access you own money!
I tried to transfer money from my account, all of a sudden I was logged out of the app and the fraud team call me to confirm the transaction. I confirmed all was fine and it was myself, I then got told another team would call me back in 12/24 hrs.
After 48 hours of waiting with no call back, I decided to call the same number that called me, (the fraud team) so I could speak to someone and find out what was going on, I had to call back numerous times and being on hold for over 1hr & 10 mis the first time, then got hung up on and then called back and waiting 48 mins to get shouted at by some mouthy little girl who couldn‚Äôt even spell. I was told I would have to wait 24/ 48 hrs for a different team to call me.
Lucky I have a credit card.... NOT WITH NATWEST, but would have been left with no money to feed my little girl and pay my bills etc. MASSIVE INCONVENIENCE & VERY CRUEL OF THEM.
Here it is x3 days later and they have decided to text me advising that my account will be closing and that they no longer want to provide me with banking services.
Like what the hell?!
I was advised by Warren in their fraud team I could go into branch with my I.D. to withdraw my money from both my business and personal accounts, which I attempted today, a Saturday only to arrive at branch and branch advised me that they need authorisation to release my money... IT IS MY MONEY!!!
Apparently I have to go back on Monday as they didn‚Äôt have cashier desks open on a weekend... that is not my problem. What an absolute shambles of a bank, I really do not know what they are playing at and DO NOT recommend them to anyone, I will also be convincing my family members and friends to change banks to anything other than NatWest.
UPDATE....
Popped into branch today with my I.D. as advised on the Saturday to withdraw my money from my accounts due to NatWest closing them for no valid reason what so ever.
Rachael, branch manager in Bristol was very helpful and called the fraud team while I was there to try and rectify this and get me my money but unfortunately the fraud team advised me that regardless o previously being advised I could go into branch to withdraw my money with my I.D., that they wouldn‚Äôt release my money from my account for me and was told that I have to fill out a form to request a withdraw to another account and this could take up to 60 DAYS??!!
Absolutely ridiculous, they are thieving swines and messing me around, the fraud team are rude and not clear with what needs to happen to get my money back. They go back on their word, advising you to do one thing then changing their minds when it suits for what? To annoy customers and antagonise them. Still do not have any reason as to why my account has been closed either.
I am appalled at the way I have been treated and stand by my comment that I DO NOT recommend NatWest to anyone ever due to their complete disregard for customers and resolving situations. It‚Äôs almost as though they know they have power as a bank and like to bully and abuse people during a pandemic this has been dreadful to say the least.
I look forward to the day NatWest go through the hoop and cease to exist.

What a joke of a bank. Don't become a victim of fraud with these clowns. Their investigation consists of ensuring they don't have to recover your lost money, don't follow up with the police and see where to money went and info you, it's gone. That's it. As for after care, they tell you, that you'll receive a new card and details in the mail in 3-5 working days. Nearly 3 weeks later, nothing. I can't access my account. Pay anyone. Can't contact the bank by phone because my details no longer work. You get the run around on their website. Avoid this bank at all costs.

Fine if I could access it but despite over 5 hours of on line chat and phone calls, I cannot find anyone with the authority to take responsibility and put it right.

My son‚Äôs student account with National Westminster was blocked in 19 November of 2019 without any valid reason given.
We were told by The Financial Ombudsman that it is in within NatWest guidelines ‚Äò(Terms and conditions) to do so.
My son received this text message saying-
IMPORTANT
Following a review of your banking arrangements, we have made the decision that we can no longer offer you banking facilities. Accounts have been blocked & a letter sent to advise this decision & next steps. This decision is in line with the T&Cs of your account & we are unable to discuss the rationale for this.
There was no letter sent regarding the closure of his account.. He couldn‚Äôt log into his account nor use his bank card immediately after receiving that message. He had no money for food or any other means for me to get money to him. He was distraught, shocked stressed, disappointed, emotional distressed and defrauded. He could not sleep because of a level of worry. He was an emotional wrecked student.
His Natwest account was opened in 2001 as a savings account. In 2019 he requested for NatWest to turn it into a student account which they did.
In December 2019 National Westminster sent him a threatening letter regarding the ¬£500 overdraft they gave him at the start. Now! where must he get that money from so soon knowing he was living off his overdraft away from home. His dad sent him ¬£160 and they took it which left him without. This overdraft was to be paid back at the end of the 3 years by the agreement of the bank. The outstanding balance is around ¬£140. This overdraft was not a loan so they should have set up payment plan with him.
By January they sent his name to debt collectors {Moorcroft}
By February there was a default on his credit file
NatWest is the worse and disgusting bank ever. Please do your research on this bank before you decide to open an account with them.
My son had been a victim of Kafkaesque

I've only given them one star because I can't give zero. They sent over ¬£2000 ponds of my money to the wrong account, and have done nothing to attempt to get it back apart from blaming the other bank. I've proved that it's not the other banks fault at least once but there's still no attempt to address the issue-although I have found out through an online article that they have 'beefed up' their security systems so it can't happen to other people while simultaneously denying they did anything wrong!!

After banking with NatWest for over 5 years, I've recently had my account closed down overnight without doing anything wrong or given any explanation, only that they consider that i have broken their terms and conditions which i haven't. All my funds have been withheld and are being withheld by the bank for up to 60 days. After carefully reading the bank's terms and conditions, i am 110% sure i have not broken any, definitely NOT committed any fraud (reason why bank can withhold funds for up to 60 days). After being told that my account was closed by going in branch and speaking with the account closure team a couple of times. I find out today that my account is still active and receives funds although i have no access to it or to any funds on it. I've asked for my bank statements up until the account closure so i know the exact amount i'm supposed to get back as all my salary and any kind of funds are stuck there, today after speaking with the Account closure team, i find out that i only have around 600¬£ out of 3183¬£ but why i ask, the answer being that its maybe related to the to the personal loan i have taken out and the credit card money i owe , mentioning that i have paid money in my credit card account and last time i've spoken to the closure team i have been instructed to arrange a standing order just a few days before the normal paying date on my new bank account(with another bank) to pay back the money i owe in instalments as i did until now. The bank has taken the liberty of paying off the loan and credit card apparently out of my funds without my consent and without me knowing. I cant believe this has happened and i don't see how this can be legal, it is my money and the decision to close down my account was not mine and i have not done anything wrong. I dont understand how an institution so big can commit such acts and take money from me without my consent. For anyone reading, please do not open an account with this SHADY BANK!!!!

I submitted ALL required documents, including id, proof of address, bank statement from another UK bank. My application went through and yesterday I even got a confirmation that my account is approved and card is on its way. Today however I got another follow emailsaying my application was declined giving no reasons but general quote of credit check. I didn't apply for a credit account or credit card but a debit account and debit card, so I don't see how any of that has an impact on opening an account.

I have complained to them over and over again and they have never once investigated. I have highlighted a number of failures with their staff, processes and they have made promises. On the back of that they send totally vague emails dismissing my complaint but without ever having checked out anything I have highlighted. If they had they would list out the complaint and they would say what their findings were.
Their service is appalling and I pay them for the privilege by the way with annual fees and all my families money in their bank. It‚Äôs disgusting how they treat people and they are purposefully obstructive. The regulators have to do something serious with them.

Natwest has closed my account without any notice and I'm unable to access my money. Just by text saying they cannot discuss it by phone nor in the branch and that I will receive a letter with the next steps, also saying the letter might take longer to receive. Seeing other reviews and news articles I see it can take up to 60 days to be refunded after you fill in a form. Luckily I didn't have all my savings there I transfered some money from my salary account monthly, but can't believe they could do such a thing and leave people without their money and no explanation. My partner was also from Natwest and has removed all his money and will be closing his account.

I've banked with NatWest for over thirty years. In the last few years customer service has been non existent, the bank has gone totally downhill.
Applied for Business ac (which I've had previously) was told 7-10 working days two months (42 working days) later nothing, just excuses!
Hours to answer the phone (then cut you off) weeks to reply to email, months to open accounts. Shocking ! Do your self a favour bank elsewhere, anywhere except NatWest, they are not the bank they use to be!
Sign of the times when you need to treat banks like utility companies and shop around swap and change, unfortunately loyalty means nothing and now is actually penalised.

Terrible Bank! Tried to port my mortgage to another property. It's the same borrowing, same repayment, same LTV, same repayment term and they wont accept it. Said they dont accept furlough payments as proof of income from my PAYE job. And they also will not accept my self employed earnings as I have less than 2 years books. I'm only trying to move house.
When they tell you it's easy online and over the phone they are lying. You have to do a complete new mortgage application and prove your income just to move house.
I'm now forced to stay in the house I am in or pay them ¬£thousands in early redemption charges to borrow elsewhere.
I renewed my mortgage 2 months ago and specifically asked the woman, will I have a problem porting my mortgage as my house is sold, otherwise I'll have to pay the redemption charges and she said "no itll be no problem at all". Now they want the money for me to leave or I lose my buyer and my purchase.
Been with them for 32 years and had 2 problems in the last year with them. Time to move everything to another bank! They wont help me so I will not help them.

Unable to give zero stars. It appears many many other people have experienced the same as me, account closure with refusal to explain why.. I don't really care to be honest, these guys are jokers.. I'm sticking with Monzo - screw you Natwest you utter fools.

Was adviced by a Nat West personel in Taunton to use telephone banking. Waited an hour on the phone for a service. When I did speak to someone was told they were only dealing with fraud cases no other type of banking.

Utterly appalling service and incompetency.
I tried 3 times to move a direct debit payment for a NatWest loan from my NatWest account so that I could close the account. I sent off the required form to the Manchester address twice - no result. I then went into the branch at Covent Garden where they did the same - sending it via the normal post and ALSO through their internal mail system. No result - the payments were still debited from the NatWest account. I was told I could make a complaint from the Covent Garden Branch and stayed to do so, staying with the manager in his office waiting on the 'phone for almost 20 minutes. Unfortunately, the complaints team must have been very busy that day as we never got through to anyone. After 20 mins I had to go back to work but the manager kindly stayed on the 'phone to wait. He rang me later in the afternoon to say that he had got through but couldn't make a complaint as I had not been with him in the office at the time. The direct debit - almost a year after I first started to try to change it is still coming out of the NatWest account I wanted to leave. I also went into the Strand branch where they were less helpful - they said it was nothing to do with the branch and couldn't help although they did say they would try and call someone. I sat waiting in my lunch hour. The lady who went to call had still not returned after almost 15 minutes and I left.
Today, trying to help my mother who is elderly and has no online banking we spent an hour waiting for someone to answer the phone. A fortnight ago, mum went round and round the automated system before giving up trying to speak to someone.
At the present time, all phone helplines are of course very busy - but I have called the mortgage company, a loan company and a credit card company within the last few days - waiting a maximum of 15 minutes to speak to someone, and in 2 cases, considerably less.
NatWest - I don't believe you couldn't have arranged the direct debit to be taken from another bank, I don't believe you make a proper effort to provide easy access to telephone service with an agent - very important for those who are elderly.
I am very happy to be contacted about what I consider to be dirty tricks.

If review.co.uk allows zero rating, I will no doubt give zero to Natwest! Such a shame on once a glorious banking brand in the UK. NatWest stands for shitty service and carelessness. They don't care about you and the service is unbelievably painful and wrong. And it's taking 3 months to get processed.
I applied for a business bank account for my start-up company in December 2019, now is almost end of March and they came up with numerous reasons and demand for supporting documents that you won't understand. I gave a good indication of my business intends to do and had a very long and detailed conversation with one of their case handlers at the very beginning of the process. That same person is coming up with all sorts of requests every now and then. It's like pushing the last bit of toothpaste in the tube. Sooooooo s....l.......o.......w............ !
Because we work with overseas business to promote the best of British products and services, they scrutinise heavily on verifying our potential suppliers. This is a new business, it's not like we have been trading for a decade. And if your supplier isn't from an English speaking country or region, they told you they couldn't verify that company. It's like they expect all other country to issue business certificates in English even if it's not their official language.
Two months after my initial application, I finally went through the verification process. This case handler guy actually sent me an email saying no worries you will have the bank account opened in a few days. The bank is just going through some final steps. And we won't need anything else from you! bla-bla-bla. So I was rest assured that my account will finally be ready shortly. A real liar and total time-wasting idiot!
Guess what, a few days later. He sent me another email saying because you intend to do this, we need to see this document. I got really confused and if this is needed, why not inform me to go and prepare for this document. This is after 2 months, and you tell me I need to get another document. Didn't you say I don't need no more documents?? Din't I tell you what the business is all about? Why it never came to your peanut-sized brain that this document is required?
This bank deserves to go out of business. If customers don't mean anything to you, you don't deserve my any business!
I have been a Natwest customer for over 15 years. I just spent another 90mins listening to their stupid music trying to get through to the compliant team but guess what... no answer!
Good by Natwest! and Fxxk You! Enough is enough.

I had what would have been a far more difficult phone call had it not been for Sam at Natwest. He was so kind, and empathetic and I felt so valued. I dont usually leave reviews as the potential for negative response is a daunting thing for me but Sam lifted such an enormous weight off my shoulders. I dont think I've ever had such customer service before, I certainly didnt deliver that level when I was customer facing.

I was very keen to transfer my mortgage over to NatWest Offset, unfortunately the so-called mortgage adviser couldn‚Äôt answer my very simple question, tell me how much my monthly payment would be or how much the product would cost. I then decided to call them and spend 30mins on hold and still nobody was capable of helping me ----- I would strongly suggest you train your staff on the products they are offering !!!!!!!

Be aware,
Natwest is going to be in financial troubles soon, read the news on newspapers. Better take away your money from this disrupted bank. Thousand of complaints have been lodged against Natwest especially because miss use of customer‚Äôs funds. Basically with various excuses they retain and use your funds. As I see the FCA and Ombudsman are not protecting the customers rights and it‚Äôs very concerning. I had stolen from my account hundred of thousand of pounds from NatWest and they don‚Äôt give any explanation. I had to instruct a lawyer to act against them. This is theft !

I was living overseas, and both my wife and I had Natwest accounts. Natwest first demanded I provide information while refusing to say why but with the threat hey would close my account if I didn't give it to them. They refused to tell me where to send it saying it would be in an email that they didn't send, and when I rang the second time and they started again I hung up.
My complaints on the way the calls had gone only focused of course on the fact that I hung up, it ignored that I was practically begging them to tell me over the phone where to send what they wanted.
Natwest have a habit of that, listening and reading only as much as they want, with an attitude 'if you don't like it go to the ombudsman'.
They closed my account anyway, and made clear, they were under no obligation to say why!
My wife they just wrote and said they were closing her account, very sorry etc., but they also wouldn't say why. It was an account I was putting money into pay for her cancer treatment, I asked them not to, they ignored me completely and they did of course close it, and put the funds into some dormant account. She couldn't do anything with the cheque they sent because she had no other sterling account.
She passed away from the cancer, and since then it has been a battle with natwest all the way. First writing to advise them she died, which they simply acknowledged. Ringing them up, the person on the phone refused to tell me what to send to get the money that was in the dormant account back, but I could write to Bereavement Services (BS).
The BS department ignored every part of my letter and just sent me the same response I already had.
I rang them up about this, complained no one read my extensive letter, and I was then promised a cheque would be sent out.
I also at the same time complained.
When nothing arrived, I got back onto them yet again, only to be told now, I needed to get a Grant of Probate, in order to protect the customers funds. Err, that is the dead customer, whose funds were put into the account by me, from my own natwest account?!
I finally received an email telling me I needed to get a grant of probate.
Someone also rang me to discuss this, but by now, with natwest lying to me, refusing to tell me what was needed, lying to me again, when the person on the phone started with the usual garbage about recording the call for 'training and quality', I lost it, and hung up.
I emailed them asking for details of the money that was in the dormant account so I could get it back, but that was ignored.
I received then a letter that ignored most of my complaint, said they had no idea what happened, but I needed to get a grant of probate. They failed to tell me anything usefull that would be necessary to get that grant of probate.
I emailed again, and was ignored.
I made another complaint, which was in December, and I've only received the response now 8 weeks later 18 February, telling me I hung up them so it was my fault I didn't receive information.
However, finally, after 4 months of constantly contacting this bank, I finally have the information I need to do what the bank demands I must do in order to get my own money back!
Oh, they also said, where I complained about their response to the first complaint, they 'think it was fair'.
Yeah, I'm sure they do.
There are so many reviews of how this bank behaves towards customers, this approach that I have dealt with seems now deliberate policy.
I would hope the ombudsman does something, and yes I have made a complaint, but I don't hold my hopes too high that this arrogant bank will be brought to heal.
If you have an account, I really recommend moving to somewhere else.

I have been living ina property in Nottingham for 12 months. I receive mail addressed to previous residents and always return to sender - gone away- and put it back in the post.
I have received multiple letters sent from "Your Business Profile' to someone whose name is unknown to me. I have returned so many identically addressed letters, that I can't now remember the exact number - 7 or 8, perhaps. The last 2 I returned with 'Deceased" and "Never lived here'.. I got another one this monring and opened it, as I think that it to see if there was a simple way of getting their system updated.
It's from Natwest Bank. They should know better. Their systems should be able to deal with something like this, simply and quickly. My way of delaing with this - simply and quickly - is to post the letter here and leave a poor review. Any more letters get shredded.

I've banked with natwest for 16 years but am looking at moving banks now. Last year Natwest have closed alot of stores but the biggest problem is their lack of customer service. The last straw is Natwest refusing to send out my new card to my address and insisting it goes to the bank. 8 working days later 11 days altogether and I'm having to drop in every day to be told its not here. No access to my own account or money for 11 days is unacceptable. Cards should be printed and sent out next day if needed as people desperately need them.

"Will Never Be A Natwest Customer Again Thank Goodness","‚Äú
I was living overseas, with my wife, and we were both Natwest customers. I had my pay going into the account. Natwest first demanded from me proof of ID and proof of address, then gave me the run around when I asked why, at first repeating the blather of 'important to have an up to date profile of you', and when I challenged why, they cited legal and regulatory reasons, which they then said they had 'no obligation to disclose'. Made it clear though it was my 'choice' whether I gave them anything, but if I didn't they might consider closing my account.
To send anything though, well they failed to provide any address to send anything to when I specifically requested it, said it would come in an email which it didn't, instead I got a useless email asking me to contact them again, and then when I did we went into the death spiral of them again with the same stupid blather as previously.
Eventually I hung up, and wrote a complaint, to which Natwest staff said I had refused to speak to them, which is a complete lie. They refused to provide me with anything when i repeatedly asked for it!
So I got a certified copy of my passport and ID, sent it to them and they then closed my account for reasons they were 'not obliged to disclose'.
For why wife, for whom I had been putting money into her account to pay for cancer treatment where we lived, they just closed her account with 'so sorry' that might convince a lawyer but no one else. I asked them to reconsider due to my wife's circumstances, but they completely ignored all correspondence. She had only been a customer for I think 25 years so obviously not an important one.
As she could barely speak, could barely walk, she couldn't do anything they wanted to transfer the balance of funds, so they helpfully sent a Sterling cheque when now she had no bank account anywhere.
Fast forward, she passed away, from Stage 4 cancer. I wrote to Natwest, and said she has died, could I have the balance of funds, so they helpfully acknowledged and said her account was closed.
Rang them up, said what I had written about but they had no records of any letter, even the reference I cited was unknown. The 'bereavement team' refused to do anything to help, wouldn't write to me, wouldn't give an email address, I had to write to them first. So I did, got a certified copy of the death certificate (I was the notifier on the death certificate and clearly stated as the husband), my ID, and proof of address. Again, a letter weeks later confirming my wife's account had closed, ignoring everything else.
At this point, rang again, and spent 30 minutes in a call, mostly on hold, to go through every point all over again!
Still waiting for that cheque....
I have complained about all this latest drama, but they haven't acknowledged the complaint, so when I go to complain again I can't even give them a reference because it seems they have ignored it.
You also can't complain to the banking ombudsman about the way they behave unless you get them to acknowledge the complaints process is exhausted, so if the ignore you completely they have it sewn up.
If Natwest were any other business, they would be in serious trouble.
I will certainly never go near them again.

After 20 Years with Natwest, I am no longer a customer!
9.30am this morning NatWest's Payments & transfers went down.
29/11/19, At 12pm I transferred a large sum of money from my current account to my saving account. The money has been debited from my current account is now no where to be seen.
Natwest can not tell me when I will get my money back
Nor when the issues will be fixed.
There are no warnings to such issues ANYWHERE!
6 hours later Natwest are also still allowing payments & transfers to be made with the full knowledge they can not honour that transaction at this time.

Worst bank I've banked with. Transferred some money using mobile banking, faster payment from my Natwest account to another account. On not reaching the destination, called up the next day, asked me a bunch of questions, verification using text messages, etc after waiting on phone with Frauds team for half an hour. Then was asked to go to branch... Went to branch, took my id proof. Surely by this point it should be clear that there was no fraud. But had to wait for another 1 hr in branch and on phone with Fraud department. The branch cut the call half way, made another call thinking it was too long. Couldn't wait any longer. This is in the middle of work day because my bank account was frozen. Was asked to go again the next day back to branch. Ridiculous

It is terrible to have one's banking services taken away, and totally unacceptable that Natwest Bank has done this to me, an over 60 year old disabled person. I saw my dentist and wanted to pay me bill, but my Natwest card was declined. I then went to a Sainsburys cash machine where Natwest detained my bank card. I then had to walk to Natwest where no one helped and no one told me why they had taken away my bank card and closed my online banking service.I had to withdraw cash and this was pure discrimination and go ¬¥back to the dentist to pay my bill and then go back to Natwest to withdraw cash to be able to buy some food. Natwest treated me like a prisoner of war and no one explained why they had taken my banking away. The online chat guy indicated that there were fraudulent activities on my account which is a lie. Natwest took away my right to banking and with it my right to live. It is impossible to live without banking facilities in the UK. I am shocked. Natwest have now most probably put a fraud alert next to my name. Natwest is an inhumane and unjust bank with no heart for the elderly and disabled.They caused me great harm and damage, I am now physically ill,still under shock, and have complained to the Financial Ombudsman.

NatWest Bank is a shame. No matter if you go in a branch and want to see customer service face-to-face or if you want to speak to them on the phone. The majority of staff seem to be incompetent and they also have no customer service skills. Whenever I went to the branch (any branch in London), most of the time there is no receptionist at the desk. And branch managers seem the have the same incompetence just like normal staff members. If trying to speak to customer service on the phone, one has to wait a long time until somebody answers the phone. Just like the queue in the branches. And then you get an answer as if it‚Äôs no answer. Avoid this bank if you can.

Shocking! Online banking was disabled nearly week ago, I‚Äôve called everyday, was told several times I would get a call back which never happened. It wasn‚Äôt sorted. I was told in every call ‚Äòsorry‚Äô This wasn‚Äôt good enough. I shouldn‚Äôt have had to call every day. I told them I needed to login to make a payment, it still wasn‚Äôt sorted. Very angry and upset about this.i had to say I couldn‚Äôt make payment and Natwest are useless

On every visit a customer has to stand for an hour or more in the que.
The employee are very disrespectful, on tell the employee that I to work as a Admin Supervisor and we don't treat customers in this manner I was told that every company is different.
So does that mean that they will treat me disrespectful.
Very bad customer service, I very dispointed.

Created a appointment online to talk to someone in branch.
Walked in and was directed to the appropriate waiting area. The wait time was minimal.
The lady who I was meeting took me to a little room and had a lovely chat with me about all sorts of things. It was like being with a friend rather than being interrogated by the bank.
She helped me with what I had come in to do and wasnt too pushy about anything, offering me other bits and bobs along the way but only things that would benefit me.
While I was there she noticed my home insurance and did a quick quote to see if she could get it any lower for me and sorted out new life insurance, which I had been trying to sort myself but struggled.
She offered me drinks throughout and made me feel extremely welcome!

I've banked with Natwest for 14 years.
I never really have to use online chat, or call. Today I did both, and what a shock I got.
I need to prove that I've paid a bill
(I have) so asked Natwest what the best way to do it was. I was looking at my statement while I was talking to both. Neither representatives appeared to see what I was seeing.
If I could see that the item had be paid, why couldn't the representatives??
They've also got rid of the freephone number, and the chat operators need to be told the same query three times, in detail.
I still haven't had my query resolved.
The woman at telephone banking's shift must have been ending, as she cut me off when I asked to speak to a manager. 14 years a customer, and this is how you are treated.
Very disappointed.

What a bunch of amateurs. I would not trust them with Monopoly Money. Customer Service is appalling. No access to return calls to branches even when its time critical.
To the lady who said "I can send them an email" is like a the 999 service saying I will email the paramedics during a heart attack.
The centralizing cost saving bankers that run this shambolisation should be shot rather than tucking into another 10 million bonus.
Try answering your phone, providing a service and actually recognize your customers.

I would absolutely not rate Natwest any stars. Seriously who employs the customer service team and what criteria is needed to work in their customer service? My 3 year old son has more common sense and logic than these people. They all are extremely rude and ignorant! None of them understand what customer service is and they have no clue what their product is nor the knowledge to be able to communicate with customers and resolve any issues or answer a basic question. It is absurd! Throughout stressful times related to money matters you need a good customer service team who try to understand the situation and resolve the matter best they can. What you do get, is a rude, abrupt agent on the phone with no knowledge of anything. They are quick to put the phone down on you, have to initiative to ask if they dont know and are simply just completely and utterly careless of the job. Why these people have a job when they clearly dont care for it is mistery.
I would not recommend this business to anyone. Try calling customer service, you will need to be able to speak in a aggressive manner for them to understand what you are trying to say. Complete idiots!

Absolute joke of company, highly irritating experience. Seriously looking at other options for personal banking. I‚Äôve never had any problems with Lloyds bank in this way.
Having taken a third party mandate on my fathers account, after having traveled 150 miles to take my disabled father to his nearest branch to complete the required documents what ensued was a domino effect of problems which prevented us from carrying out the simplest of tasks, such as transferring money....
Days elapsed where deposits of cash ‚Äòvanished‚Äô; and nobody could explain why!
I eventually had no choice but to travel back to his location and take him, yet again to ‚Äòauthorise‚Äô the transfers. They even had the cheek to ask what the money was for? Is this not a breech of privacy and just dam right rude?
It literally took weeks to resolve the issues concerning the whereabouts of cash transfers and to resolve these blocks sanctioned on the account. It was a case of back and forth, pillar to post. None of the NatWest colleagues seem to know what was going on.
The icing on the cake moment, NatWest failed to send out a replacement debit card before the expiry date; is this not their responsibility by default?
The repercussion of that being a cancelled online food order which meant he had nobody to turn to and I had been powerless to rectify the problem. So he has to cope without the food for a few days until the next available delivery slot. Luckily I was able to use the secondary card which I have in my procession to set up the payment.
I am so disappointed and have reached the point where I have absolutely no trust in this bank what so ever.

Horrible and rude customer service.
On hold for 20 minutes calling from Australia. Needed to speak to Natwest to have my credit card unblocked, despite me telling then that I would be travelling to Australia.
After finally being connected they tell me their systems are undergoing planned maintenance - why on earth couldn't they say that at the beginning of the phone call.
The rude phone call operator hung up on me when I asked him why I had to be on hold for 20 minutes before they could inform me that they wouldn't be able to access any if my account details to help me.
This is just the latest of my many problems with Natwest, although I think this is the final straw and I'm going to go back to Lloyd's Bank as soon as I can.

Absolutely disgusting company! I am the victim of fraud and Nat West have breached every FDA rule I can think of!
They allowed a fraudster to open an account at my address and send the card to a random address which is now linked to my credit file and they (NatWest) has the audacity to write to me 3 weeks later telling me the case has been resolved and that they believe the account is genuine, despite sending me this letter to my current address not the frausters, that they sent the card to.
I can‚Äôt pass security as I don‚Äôt have the debit card, sort code or account number and why would I? t‚ÄôThey haven‚Äôt sent this to my address!! Which means in turn I can‚Äôt posibly identify myself and I can only summarise from their pathetic reply that the fraudulent account is still active and the fraudsters are racking up a bill under my name!
I have rang and get diverted to many different advisors that are absolutely clueless, they have no policies in place, they won‚Äôt share their policies to show me how someone has opened an account in my name and how they possibly could have sent the card to a different address???
I have never ever dealt with such incompetence from a company that should is financially regulated, is an authority that has a duty of care to the public and should be highly regulated!
These are basic financial laws that Natwest are braking! You (the organisation) can only send something to the address it was credit checked! If this was the case it should have been sent to me and I would have called 10 months ago! but no I find out by chance via my own credit file that I am the victim of fraud!!
My next step is to request all information they have on the fake me under GDRP! As they won‚Äôt tell me their processes and policies but hopefully this way I will find out what ID these fraudster used!!
I have in addition and because of NatWest raised a crime with action fraud to be told that identify theft is not a crime!! WHAT!! Only NatWest can raise this and apparently they think the account is genuine???
- Having the fraudulent address on my credit file I rang the police surprise surprise not interested!
- Paid for a CIFA alert on all my credit file which apparent protects me against future fraud, yet NatWest don‚Äôt even think this is fraudulent! How am I the victim supposed to understand that comment!!
- Paid for my credit files with all 3 major companies
- Now paying ¬£15 month with Experian to immediately alert me of any activity on my account
Yet none of this is sufficient for NatWest!!!
-Raised a complaint with the financial ombudsman 3 weeks ago and yet to hear anything back? I will be following it up tomorrow.!!
Tell me what is the point in the law if it allows for the banks to screw the honest! Take no responsibility or accountability and penalise the innocent and honest ones.
I am going to ensure NAtWest is held accountable and will do everything humanly possible to fight this and ensure everyone is made aware that this is a dishonest, incompetent bank that should have no place in the UK! It‚Äôs about time the regulators did something about this shambolic company!!!
Not even a customer and I would never ever ever recommend anyone to bank with these Charlatons!!!!!!

Apart from the annoying but somewhat fair security procedures (blocking cards for high value transactions), not too bad of a bank although there are better.
The new online banking log in procedure that some moan about is out of the banks control. Educate yourself on new banking regulation to minimise fraud. These changes are across the industry so changing banks ain‚Äôt gonna do much for you. You‚Äôll most likely find yourself in a similar situation. Also keep your contact details up to date it ain‚Äôt too much too ask for.

Natwest. Where do I start.!
They have just closed my joint account with zero notice and zero explanation. They hide behind a blanket that a decision has been made and cannot be reversed. No-one is prepared to enter a discussion. What business closes a customer account with zero communication, they would not deserve to be in business. The only reason I found out was because i tried to use my card in a store and it was declined, then yesterday, i spent nearly 3 hours on a holding pattern as I was passed from department to department.....and still no explanation. They finally said that a letter was sent yesterday (some 3 days after the account was closed), which would be the first official communication that the account was being closed. An account that has never been in arrears.

To start with, I am not a frustrated customer, this one is just a review.
I think Natwest is a scam, they are holding the power and charging people for every little transaction they make, in another country below are the things you can do from a cash machine
1. You are on the way to the airport, you need urgent cash exchange. You should be able to do from a cash machine, since Natwest cash machines are dated back to 1991 it does not work for you.
2.Your children need urgent cash, they lost their wallet, you should be able to send money to their mobile phone with a pin number, Natwest does not offer this service either. There is a service called send money to mobile which natwest does not offer.
3.You should be able to draw money using your mobile phone( this has been introduced recently as a big news ) but guess what in most countries you can take your money with QR codes without needing of a bank card.
4.There should be a cardless menu in the cash machine where you can pay your bills, traffic fines and other payments using your id number which natwest does not offer either.
5. Again you should be able to pay in money from a cash machine or pay your bills, cash machine should give you the change ( either in coins or notes) which natwest does not offer either
6.You need to top up your phone, you should be able to do from a cash machine
7 .There are 10 -15 more services that I can t remember at the moment that Natwest does not offer that you should be able to do from the mobile phone application.
8.In a bank you should be seated and wait not stand in a queue as if 1900 communist country.
So Natwest service is, comparing to world standards, is a joke, but you have no other options to choose from so not sure what you can do about it. If Natwest offers any of these services they can't charge you for every little thing they do again this is bullying.

I witnessed sheer arrogance and aggressive rudeness from one of the female staff members towards a gentleman last week. He was trying to sort out a problem and from her tone and attitude it was clear she thought he was the problem. She told him that her colleague had already gone 'above and beyond ' to help him and he politely pointed out that he would have no way of knowing what was Nat west policy in terms of going above and beyond. The interchange carried on for a good 10 minutes and while I would rather not have been waiting in the queue I was more worried about the crass and unprofessional treatment of another customer.

After a human error at a local branch I called the business banking telephone number to try to correct the issue, I was told that the branch would call within 30 mins and 3 hours, in the end I went to the branch a 25 mile round trip. Okay so the branch made an error but the point is that the staff somewhere in Merseyside i believe, were so rude, obstructive and all I could hear was "huffing" on the line. When this was commented on the obnoxious woman said I'm ending this conversation and "click!".

I've banked with Natwest for over 20 years and had no problems with them. I've had hassle trying to set up a new payee on my account as this must be done using a key card, all of which have never worked, meaning this must be done over the phone or in branch. Other than this they've treated me pretty well. I've also banked with Barclays who regularly tried to defraud my account! Thankfully have now cut all ties to Barclays and will stay with Natwest.

NatWest is awful! It is seriously the worst bank I‚Äôve come across to date. I only switched to them in January due to their ¬£150 monetary offer.
So far as I‚Äôve spoken to telephone banking I‚Äôve been in tears twice due to not being able to pay a bill due to their stupid ¬£500 daily limit. I have asked for them to remove the restrictions as I am the customer and it is my money. They told me to go to the bank as I didn‚Äôt have 3rd tier security on my account which you get when you log on with a card reader !
So why didn‚Äôt you send me a card reader when I opened the account. I got no answer and now wait for it same problem ! It‚Äôs 3 weeks on and it‚Äôs still not arrived!
Customer service is so poor it‚Äôs shocking. You end up in a passive aggressive conversation within a telephone handler saying she will hang up the phone on you. Seriously NatWest need to insure they train people more effectively because I don‚Äôt think they know what they are doing. In my 2 separate conversations with NatWest I‚Äôll only say I spoke to one manager who I‚Äôve been happy with as he empathised with my issue instead of the typical your fault sort it.
Also do not switch! It turns out they only pay the incentive in April and my assumption is that this is to ensure their figures are through to show their customer count. I applaud them for the rouse as I can‚Äôt remeber if that was in the terms I read. I will be leaving NatWest for another bank this time
I‚Äôll ensure I read reviews and I think NatWest should ask other banks how they can improve as this will not keep customers

As a customer of over 20 years, never has Natwest been such a shambles. Whether they've had a new strategy in the past 2 years or something, I don't know, but if they have, it's likely titled "let's see how annoyed we can make our customers". The strategy is working.
Get rid of Saturday banking, so now customers have no idea how much they have in their accounts, whilst simultaneously direct customers to the "pending" area in the app that holds some pending transactions, but not all ( hence no idea how much money is in the bank).
Complaints department doesn't open until 7am?! Why? I say how rubbish Natwest is, you record it and ignore it. Easy.
From September I can't even call anyone to discuss how rubbish they are. That's what I call fixing the problem. I envisage the natwest board members sweeping their bad stuff under the bed, sticking their fingers in their ears and going "tralalala".
Two decades a customer natwest, there won't be a third.

After waiting a week for a call back just to arrange a call about my mortgage and then losing over an hour of my life discussing my mortgage, I find that they don't offer their competitive rates to existing customers, just the new shiny ones. I'll be off to find a bank that will value my custom.

NatWest accepted my account opening, a week later they told me that ACTUALLY they rejected it so they would close it. So they kept my money (¬£1500). I had to go to a branch and waste time to get my money back only that they kept some of it for service charges for that week of account.
Do they do this with every customer? Sounds like a scam.
Never again NatWest.

Utterly disgusting.
Twice I had to book appointment
and on both occassions was not seen.
Banks fault
1. Bank did not advice me a certain timescale of documents was required
2. Bank booked appointment with a customer advisor who was working at a branch elsewhere not to the one I had specifically requested.
I was appaled at the lack of customer service by Natwest.
On the second appointment due to lack of capacity within the branch I was not seen.
I stressed this was second time booked I urgently needed to open an account and had also come during my break I should be prioritised
But no just a little show of sorry.

Thankfully I have never had to deal with such awful customer service before. As soon as I possibly can, I will be going else where. It appears I'm not the only person who has had countless issues with them either. Trust Pilot has given them a 1* as well. In my personal experience they have absolutely no compassion what so ever, and are incredibly unhelpful when trying to explain a situation to them. The standard response is, terms and conditions, what do you want us to do about it? You try to explain that your circumstances have changed and you want to ensure you pay them back what you owe them, they fob you off.

I‚Äôve been banking with them for years and I am truly disgusted and dissatisfied with their service . I‚Äôve been the victim of fraud on various occasions with them but still remained a loyal customer with them. I was recently the victim of another scam this time via telephone and no one seemed to take responsibility for the poor security measures in place or acknowledge the fact that I‚Äôve been subjected to fraud on many occasions . Instead I was told that they would not be refunding my money as it was my fault this happened and was even hung up on by one of their employees . I have not been able to have any form of access to my account nor have I been advised as to how I can access it and have instead been told that I have to wait to receive a new card as my old card has been cancelled so have had to rely on the financial support of others. When informing them that I would be taking my services elsewhere I was more or less told to go ahead . It‚Äôs disgraceful that I cannot even rely/ trust my my own bank to take care of my hard earned money . Do not bank with these people !

I think the Question "what went wrong" is a wrong question. It should be asked " How can we disappoint you more" The bank should send a survey to its customers and ask if there was anything they did right, if so they will do their utmost to ensure that next time they will ensure that the customer is provided the usual poor service.

Since May 2017 (it is now December 2019) I have been harassed over my tax residency status. I keep filling in forms telling them that I left Republic of Ireland in 2001 after only having been there a year, and have been back in the UK since then. Eventually, with no satisfaction, I went into a branch. The assistant made a phone call and said that it was due to the bank still having a phone number on my records relating to Ireland. We duly changed this - I had my passport id with me, so that it was possible. We then completed the forms FOR THE UMPTEENTH TIME, and ALL of the forms were taken by the bank to be posted using the bank post. I expected to hear NOTHING more on this issue. But today, 20th December, I have had YET FURTHER HARRASSMENT, telling me that if I don't reply and complete the forms within 10 days, my details will be passed on to the tax body. NATWEST HAS NO RIGHT TO PASS ON MY DETAILS, AND THIS COULD CAUSE ME NO END OF GRIEF FROM AN OVERSEAS TAX OFFICE. How DARE YOU NATWEST? I have tried phoning the 'Helpline' on the letter - after 20 minutes STILL NO ANSWER, and I am being charged because it is not a free phone number! What a truly disgusting bank! I have banked with the NatWest for years. Once I have my pound of flesh with this bank - I'm off. You disgusting shower!

Utterly, utterly disgusting customer experience. Organised a friends holiday meaning a lot of people transferring me money to pay for the trip. Some gave me cash. The bank fraud 'experts' froze my accounts, asked endless amounts of question, during which time I could not access money in my account.
When visiting various branches I was laughed out of the bank who simply said "we will contact you vis letter". Letter comes and tells me that all of my accounts are CLOSED PERMANENTLY. So I have been a customer for over 15 years, and now I have been kicked out of my own bank account for "unusual activity" on my account. The bank will not communicate with me to explain why this decision was made and simply gave me 60 days to find somewhere else to bank!
I warn anyone that is thinking of joining this laughable transaction to think again and go elsewhere. Unless of course you enjoy being treated like that piece of you know what on the bottom of your shoe.

I visited India and notified Natwest of my travel dates. I tried to purchase a piece of jewellery. The payee was already in my contacts from a previous visit but my payment was not allowed.
When I returned home, I had an answerphone message on my mobile to phone the fraud department. I called immediately and they said a letter had been sent out to me. I asked for a Manager to call me but so far nobody has bothered. I have since called back twice and still nobody has called me.
I will not only be taking my current account elsewhere, I will also be moving my business elsewhere.
Every time I have a problem at Natwest, nobody calls me back.

Ever since I started banking with Natwest, there is money keeping disappearing from my account. This money cannOT be accounted for on the statement ut will completely vanish. My son is 19, he is also a customer with Natwest and is facing same experience. I went to two different Natwest branches. The response I got was shocking, the staff were rude and arrogant, they blamed me for miscalculation when I tried to show the proof of my explanation they didn‚Äôt want to know. The staff must be aware of what is happening, why getting the same response to such an important issue. There is no customer care with This bank. Can we have our money back please.

They closed down small helpful local branches. I had a text message at 10:30am to say my account was overdrawn by less than a Pound and I would have to pay the money in by 2. I only saw the message while I was having lunch at 1, and it took 1/2 hour to drive to Swindon to deposit the money.
I was expecting the only branch open for miles to be wonderful, with all the helpful staff from closed branches. Instead, I walked in and saw a bank with no counter. Just a couple of girls who looked like school leavers standing around with clip boards.
I asked one of them how I was supposed to put money in without a counter, and she started talking to me sarcastically telling me to do it myself with the machine, as if she was getting off on trying to make me look stupid. Then when she put money in machine, it took the money and broke down, so I had to wait for that to be fixed until my money went in.
Then I said that as it took me 1/2 hour to get there because of the local branches being closed and with the machine breaking, what will happen about me being less than a Pound overdrawn after 2?
She didn't know anything and was still speaking to me sarcastically, saying I will have to look online tomorrow. I asked if I could speak to another person who knows what they're doing, and eventually found another person who told me I wouldn't get charged for under ¬£10 even though I was only overdrawn for 1/2 a day. So I said if the first one could have told me that basic information, I wouldn't have been stressed, and first one was still sarcastic, saying I was stressed anyway, when I wasn't because I went in expecting a bank to have useful people who know basic information. I don't know why they're pretending to be a High Street bank, when they seem to employ the cheapest people they can find without proper training who can't do anything

NatWest was my first account too open since the beginning of secondary thereforever, I have been with them for ten years and all I can say is they are probably the worse banking company and do not recommend if you want very bad customer service and very long times to do transfers or receive it.
They recently closed my account for no reason on Friday and I was trying to take my money from the account into my other one therefore, I called them up that Friday and they said I have to go into a branch to sort it, so I went the next day and I was told to call up CS (customer service) to get them to write a note on the system, allowing me too do this and when I called them up I was told the department needed to do this was only open Monday- Friday, so you can see I was getting very irritated by this now, so today is Monday and I called them to get the right department to do this and I had called them about three times with the long waits of 20-30 minutes, the call would fail and had to explain myself to different advisors the same thing.
So I do not recommend at all and would suggest going with Barclays or Lloyd‚Äôs because, there branch has all their problems sorted there and not million of different departments to get one result by their fault in the first place.

Had a current account with Nat West for 40 ish years,in July recieved a letter from the Nat west informing me that I had recieved a fairly large sum of money from someone abroad.I checked my account and there it was in my current account.I immediately phoned Nat West and said is this scam or a problem as I do not know the sender.I was told it was perfectly OK no problem and he wished someone would send him money.
On Tuesday 23rd Oct I went to pay for an item in Boots chemist and was told my card was invalid ,I immediately went to my local Nat West they checked and said my account was frozen due to a transaction in July which was under investigation for fraud.The bank then phoned the fraud dept I spoke so someone called Sean (he refused to give his Surname) I explained what had happened it was obvious he didn't believe me ,,he maade me feel gulty and annoyed.I rerurned home found the letter and returned to the bank with it so they could send a copy.the following Day I printed off my phone calls and provided the Bank with them as proof of my Call to the bank..It is now 9 days and my account is still frozen,I need to pay some bills but can't even see my account on line.Fortunately I have some savings and am using them for fuel food etc .But supposing I had no other method of obtaining cash what would I do ? The bank ar usng bully boy tacticts refusing to discuss what is happening or how long my account will be on stop.I have taken legal advice and had it confirmed that it is the Nat West Bank who are responsible.

I think NATWEST is one of the most Appalling Banks I have ever dealt with. Used to be an excellent bank when I first opened account in the 1980s. Experienced staff replaced with inexperienced and incompetent staff. Their incompetency lead to a my mortgage rate agreed after meeting a broker not being implemented for a year! Had fraud on my account with name similar to a bank staff who served me (could purely be a coincidence and no insinuation to NATWEST). I was unable to pursue or ask questions because member of staff in question had left the bank together with the mortgage broker who served me but failed to process my paperwork. I was made to feel a criminal and stupid and the way they dealt with it was poor.
Recently (October 2018) a cheque was returned due to in sufficient funds when this was not the case as I also had a big overdraft not even used. The member of staff admitted there was no reason for the cheque to be returned to me. Tried to complain to customer services but line was disconnected.
Renewed my mortgage rate in September online (not trusting to deal with staff), sent off documents with cheque for the fixed rate charge. I received a letter weeks later informing me that due to the high volume of work they were unable to process my cheque and asked that I pay by phone!
Subject Access Request I made in May was eventually released in August. 2 months out of the 30 day timescale under GDPR.
Still have account but moved by daily activities and savings to another trusted bank. I would not recommend NATWEST to anybody. It is very unfortunate that since RBS took over NATWEST their services has continued to deteriorate to the point of me as a customer mistrusting them.
NATWEST does not appreciate loyal customers and in my opinion cannot be trusted. Given the ratings here it is obvious I am not the only one. NATWEST DO NOT ACCEPT FAULTS, DO NOT LIKE TO APOLOGISE, WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A CRIMINAL BEFORE A CUSTOMER, WOULD IGNORE YOU WITH NO EXCUSE IF THEY CANNOT HELP OR CHOOSE NOT TO. NATWEST ONLY NICE WHEN BUYING A PRODUCT. Lloyds and other banks much better and treat people more like humans.
I sincerely hope one day this bank will be restored to its full glorious days of the NATWEST we knew and admired in the 80s.

Natwest are absolutely awful and their customer service is rubbish. They had frozen my account without giving me reason leaving me without access to my money for a week then 2 weeks later i recieve a letter saying they will be closing my account again without reason. What is more annoying is the fact that everytime i rang, everyone i spoke could not tell me what was going on so i was either told to go to the branch (even the branch were unsure what was going on) or wait for them to ring me which never happened. I am absolutely fuming at them for making me feel like a criminal and making feel like ive done something wrong when i have not done anything. i wouldn't recommend anyone ever joining their branch as they do not appreciate their loyal customers who have been with them for more than 10 years. It is very unfair what they have done.

It's no wonder Natwest have 1 star on Trustpilot.
I used to think that Northern Rail were the worst company I have ever used, that was until I applied for a mortgage with Natwest.
Never have I known such woeful incompetence at every single stage of the mortgage process.
We were delayed by over a month (and are still delayed) due to multiple instances of consultants writing down very simple pieces of information down wrongly.
We paid for a home-buyer's report over a month ago and it still hasn't been done due to Natwest first getting the estate agents address wrong, then getting our address wrong, then getting our phone number wrong, then the surveyor that Natwest forced us to use cancelling on the day of the appointment!
During each of these failings we were never once informed by Natwest what was going on, and we only found out when we called up ourselves.
We are now at the stage where we have to call Natwest every day just to get some simple information out of them, this always takes around an hour as they take so long to answer the phone.
This is no way to treat paying customers, especially those you are entering into a multi-decade relationship with.
Sort it out.

Nat West Camborne Cornwall
For the last 5 months we have been receiving Nat West Statements for a company calling themselves Astute Estates, a company that has absolutely nothing to do with us! We have tried returning the mail to sender, we have complained to Nat West Head Office and on 24 August we actually came into your branch to complain face to face! We would point out that we were forced to stand in a queue for ages because your branch is so woefully understaffed. When eventually we were served the cashier said she would try ringing them and asking if they would come in and change their address. I complained that this was not good enough, whatever Nat West and your client did was not our business but we did insist that our address should be removed completely from all records relating to this company! The cashier said she would speak to the manager and get the address changed to the Nat West branch. Clearly this did not happen as yet again we have received a statement for Astute Estates. We have no idea what their financial situation is but as they are using our address without permission something which Nat West Camborne is knowingly complicit in I might add, this could seriously affect our credit rating. As well as writing this review I shall be writing to Nat West Camborne today with a view to taking legal action. There are only two names on our house deeds....and they don‚Äôt include Astute Estates....this company does not have the permission or right to use our address! Neither do we have any accounts with Nat West, thus apart from a letter of apology we do not want to receive anything further from you or any of your clients who don‚Äôt appear to know their own address!

They closed my account without explanation and refused to discuss it with me. When I got my credit report to find out what was going on it suggested that I had been the victim of fraud, although I was unaware of this. Surely a bank should help you in this situation not kick you out and refuse to talk to you! I have written to NatWest for an explanation but they have not replied in a month - appalling! Will now be writing to financial ombudsman as I believe this behaviour is in breach of their own terms and conditions. Nationwide have since helped me to open an account with them and to clear the cifas from my otherwise good credit report.

Terrible service , given wrong I formation , waited nearly 45 mins to speak to the correct person who then told me I can‚Äôt make the transfer . Avoid this bank !

Telephone banking appalling service. Waited 6 mins and no answer usual message ‚Äòhigher than normal volume of calls etc‚Äô
Called again and selected loans service....surprise surprise answered quickly!!! Then put through the entire system again....another 4 mins then told should have selected another option. Another 11 mins and still no answer just automated mesage apologising for the delay.
21 mins and no answer ...given up. Have paid ¬£ to listen to irritating music and automated message.
This happens EVERY time regardless of say of week or time of day.
Of course customers now have to pay for these calls.....NatWest are making a lot of money for unacceptable service.
Avoid this bank.....do not ever join NatWest ... it‚Äôs gone completely down the drain.

Incredibly poor experience with Natwest. I'm saying it now, Don't bloody bank with them!
I had been unwell with PTSD the past two years and that basically meant I didn't check my finances for a year or so whilst I was unemployed. So after recovering enough to finally get a new job and start earning again I try to log into my online banking to see how much money I have in there, and to see if my new wage went in. Natwest had locked all of my online banking and accounts. I was advised to go in branch - So I did. Staff told me because there was no activity for 12 months they closed my account and put all of my money on hold?! Absolutely no contact from them during this time, no bank statements, nothing through the post to notify me of this happening. I have just opened up a new account with a different banking company and am going in branch today to transfer all of my money to my new bank! Absolutely disgusted. I was with Natwest for 10 years and this amount of 'service' is just unacceptable!
Don't even bother with them!

Poor customer service. Fees for basic transactions that shouldn't cost a p in the digital era. Their bank app is very limited so for larger payments I was forced to go to the bank - something I hadn't done for years! Old fashioned.
Their staff was rude and incompetent - the cashier threat me 'I don't have to transfer your money if I don't want'. Well yes you have, the clue is in the name: it is MY money.

Also changed standing order to 26th for rent had it taken out on the 26th and the 28th original date . And have been charged again another ¬£70.00 for the banks mistake .

Worst customer service ever. I have been on the phone to the customer service to try and sort out an issue because their online banking and online credit card banking systems aren't unified (so inconvenient).
No support, understanding or even the slightest attempt to help. Their personnel need training on the fact that expats who live half way around the world cannot pop into their branches as easily as that. Next time I'm in the UK, I'll definitely be popping into a branch, not for support but to close this account! Learn to treat customers right!

Natwest doesn't even deserve one star. We have had multiple issues with the bank. The latest has been my legal change of name. Every other organisation I have dealt with (HMRC, DVLA, DWP, local council, utility providers etc) has been very helpful and understanding of me as a disabled customer with mobility and communication challenges. Not Natwest. One month on and the matter is still not resolved. The options they have offered have been "fair and reasonable" - to Natwest and not to me. To top it off they paid ¬£50 'compensation' in to my account this week and because I challenged them they then threatened to take it out again. What a lovely way to treat a disabled customer who they know is 100% dependant on her husband and, with no independent income, worries so much about money and just getting through each week, let alone month. We have been loyal customers of Natwest for over 15 years - more fool us!

The most useless bank I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with.
We opened a Natwest business account in October 2017, when we set the account up online it made no mention of linking personal accounts and joint accounts, however once we had set the account up - they linked myself and my other colleagues personal account to the business, which we did not own or have a shareholding.
Secondly, we asked for dual authorisation on the account for transactions over ¬£1,000, which the application made no issue of - however when the account was opened, this was a completely different matter. It allowed myself or my colleague to transfer money around without any authorisation etc.
When I called Natwest and asked to raise a formal complaint, they had said they have logged it on the system and would get back to me. No one ever got back to me.
After the appalling customer service, we decided to close the account almost immediately after opening. They made us jump through so many hoops.
One of our employees linked to the account was leaving prior to us closing the account, to remove her from the account as a signatory was almost impossible. I wrote a letter with authorisation to remove her, two weeks later when the employee was due to leave the company, she informed me she still had access to the account.
I called Natwest and they told me my letter would not suffice to remove her from the account - How about pick up the phone and tell me that? Instead they left it and didn't feel the need to communicate to me that specific forms had to be filled out. Even when I filled out the specific forms they said it would only take two working days and ended up taking nearly two weeks, meaning the employee had access to company funds after they had left the business! Just unacceptable, this should be instantaneous.
I would never recommend Natwest to anyone.

I would urge anyone looking to open a Natwest Business account not to even attempt it. The Business customer service advisers are shocking they give you the wrong information and the level of training is shocking.
It took 6 months to change signatories on a Community Account, even after they changed the signatories they still sent the bank statements and correspondence to the previous signatories home address, When i realized what had happened i was then advised to fill in yet another flipping form.......
If you decide to proceed with opening an account, all i can say is you have been warned !!!!

I don‚Äôt understand!!! I really don‚Äôt!!! I‚Äôve been building my account for years, I just asked for 3k loan which I can pay off in less than 2 months, I am in shock and so pained I almost feel like crying...
you should at least tell me why you have decided to close the account when I‚Äôve done nothing wrong! I‚Äôd have preferred they just refused the loan and save me this peace of mind.

I have been with this bank approx. 17 years and now locked into a fight to get my money back. I have since found out there are various articles being published online about how fraudsters are able to get into Natwest mobile app I am switching to a new bank with better security as Natwest do not care and totally refuse to help. Natwest is supposed to be financially secure institution but its far from it PLEASE DO NOT BANK WITH NATWEST.

Where do I start?
Last year we opened a joint bank account and a hard credit search was done twice on my credit file. I called the bank straight away and asked them for this to be resolved. I also told my credit reference agency that I would like to dispute the search. Couple of weeks later NatWest refused to take the second search off my file which was done because of their mistake. Made an official complaint which hasn't got resolved FOR OVER A YEAR NOW! A couple of days ago we decided to cancel our account because we were leaving the country. We went to the Twickenham branch in London and got everything some I'm 15 minutes. Finally, I thought to myself they're improving. We cancelled all our direct debits, standing orders, and the account. The next day when we were already outside the country the first direct debit went out...oh joy!!! Contacted their team and they recalled the payment and advised us that the closing of the account will take 5 working days??? Well... We were certainly not told that! I asked again if now all the direct debits were cancelled? I was told, yes and there will be nothing else going out of our account. 2 days later another payment has gone out. Once again I contacted their team and I was told that this is the account fee for the month before...I asked twice while I was in the branch of everything has been some or if there's anything else we need to pay for, I was told it's all done!! How can a bank afford so many mistakes??? It's absolutely ridiculous. This company is a joke and all customers should stay away from them. As nice their customer service people are they also useless of resolving problems! I'm going to pay for the final fee but I'll make sure my review will be everywhere on the internet to warn people.

I have no bad credit, an excellent credit file after never missing a payment (inc. Natwests mortgage and they actually sent me a letter saying I could remortgage WITHOUT CHECKS!!) and no problems whatsoever but Natwest have declined me a mortgage based on how I conducted my current account. What they mean is, I recently closed my current account with a ¬£200 overdraft facility down and they don't like it. The new mortgage would see my pay them ¬£400 less a month and they don't like that either. It's absolutely disgraceful, and they have now left me with a black mark meaning its going to be very difficult to get another strong rate elsewhere. Stay away from them.

Only option was to speak to complaints, why to be told the same thing? After 30 years, I'm now switching my banks! Can't help but wonder, who is working for whom here?

No transparency with unarranged overdraft fees. A ¬£6 transaction became a ¬£260 charge because the bank failed to alert me I was overdrawn. Despite asking for text alerts as well as email as the primary contact method, I received no emails or texts (but I did get a letter 2 weeks after the transaction - useful when you're not in the country).
Just phoned an operator to confirm text alerts for unarranged overdraft usage - he put me on hold for 20 minutes then picked up again and accidentally (?) hung up on me.

Although the smart phone app is very useful, their online banking is unbelievably frustrating to use. The concept of a banking app, with the ability to check my account is perfect, although giving a business a ¬£250 daily limit is, in my opinion, pointless. Thats the whole point of having an app, to pay bills whilst on the move. If you want to pay more than ¬£250, you have to log onto their online banking (or visit a branch). One is difficult to do, the other removes the need for an app in the first place! Very disappointed in NatWest.

They aren't helpful at all if you're robbed and lose your cash cards. I cancelled my card after answering security questions and they told me that it was fine so they would send me out my new card. Then they said my online banking had been closed and put me through to the security department who said they didn't know why I had been put through to them, but my card had definitely been ordered, and if I answer more security questions they would set up the online banking again. Then they asked me a stupid question about transactions that I couldn't remember, so I said I can't remember and could they ask another one, but he said the computer says I have to answer a multiple choice question and they have no control on what the questions are, so I said I'm not sure and would only be guessing and I don't want to guess as I have no money for food or petrol, and he was quite rude and said I had to answer it but I got the question wrong and then he said computer says so, but my card would definitely be sent out, so I said it was a stupid question and I can't believe he was so unhelpful. So I wait days for the card only eating cereal with no milk wondering why it was taking so long, and after 5 days I phone up again and they told me that there's no record of me ordering the card, so the last person i spoke to must have cancelled my card without telling me, and I'm told that I have to go into my branch which is now only open a couple of days a week. I said my petrol has nearly ran out and it's not open again for days, and I was told I should beg people for money and food until i can get to a branch. It's obvious the one who was unhelpful cancelled the ordering my card on purpose to be nasty. They made a stressful time even worse
