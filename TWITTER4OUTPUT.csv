I appreciate 9 characters are not a lot. This is the criteria we have for the mobile banking password, but to ensure security, this type of log in can be carried out only through one device. (1/2) ^Desi","0 ","0 ","0 "

 the mobile banking app hasn’t worked since the iOS update 3 days ago, which means I can’t generate a security code to get onto online banking either? When will this be sorted so that I can access my account?","0 ","0 ","0 "

   How about letting customers know via social media that your mobile banking app has crashed. For a big organisation your admin is appalling.   Half an hour on phone and half an hour trying to log on delete:reinstall app . Had checked your status and all says ok ! ","0 ","0 ","0 "
