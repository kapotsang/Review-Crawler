Wonderful email integration
HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on, while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan, and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration, HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!
What problem are you trying to solve?

What do you like?
Ability to track email exchanges within HubSpot
What do you dislike?
I just wish that I could set Outlook to automatically include HubSpot tracking. Sometimes I forget to "turn on" HubSpot from within Outlook on my first email, and then I miss part of the tracking. It is my own fault, but it is easy to overlook especially when one is in a hurry.

NOT the same as the Gmail Extension
While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same, HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change, retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well, but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.

We recently transitioned to Outlook from the Google Business Suite.

Working with HubSpot "Free" CRM is a game changer for entrepreneurs
The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription, as the updates roll out, they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before, and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues, is a game changer as well.
What problem are you trying to solve?
IT issues are no more with Office 365, and Microsoft new return call policy-under 30 minutes.

HubSpot with Outlook
The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot, linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others, extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Connections with customers, suppliers and colleagues using up to five different email accounts for different clients.
What do you like?
Outlook is fine; it works for me. It provides me access to multiple email accounts in a controllable way. HubSpot can, no doubt, in principle make the process of managing email addresses and associated messages simple.
What do you dislike?
It doesnt. It is far too complex to set up for any non techy (I am not a complete idiot but I was bamboozled). It sucked data from other email addresses in my Outlook account and shared them with colleagues who had no need, right or desire to see data from other businesses. Getting rid of HubSpot having installed it is painful.

Several problems using the new Outlook interface
The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot, until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active, the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox
What problem are you trying to solve?
The HubSpot plugin within Outlook lets me do Email tracking and saving to HubSpot

Just cant use it
Outlook is working perfectly fine. However, I want to use the outlook from with CRM, so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id, which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community, but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription, but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer, then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.

Outlook, HubSpots and VPNs... not a great idea.
We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures, it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed, or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.
What problem are you trying to solve?
All of our client communications are by email.
What do you like?
Tracks email properly
What do you dislike?
Honestly unless you're paying the whole shabang to get all the paid add-ins, the outlook integration is useless. I only want the tracking options, but the whole add-in is offering me a bunch of options... I can't use because I'm not paying. It's just cluttered AF. Also it doesn't play well with our VPN and remote desktop situation.

HubSpot plugin for Outlook 365
Outlook serves the expected purpose of our needs and as a coorporation it is by all means a known software for a lot of people. We were happy to see that HubSpot integrated with Outlook - as the funktionalities make our logging and track of email communication linked to customers easy.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Outlook is our company's primary mailing and calendar system as so many other companies.
What do you like?
As Outlook is part of the Microsoft 365 package it's difficult to avoid. As a tool that fits both small and large organisations and is so widely spread - we of cause use it as well.
What do you dislike?
As an installed application you some time see difficulties to solve issues, due to the "hidden" datafiles. So once it has gone wrong it might be difficult to fix. NOTE: If you run multible email accounts in your Outlook application the HubSpot add-in application gets "confused" and sometimes gives an internal Outlook error. If that ocurs you'll need to change this to single user login to make it work.

Great in concept but really slows down productivity
The integration with Outlook is important, but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop, not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned, it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall, we have to use it, but it's not great.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Syncing contacts/communication, finding easy links to meetings, documents and email snippets/templates.

Outlook & HubSpot
Without Outlook we'd not be able to function. The plugin with HubSpot is honestly a bit wonky though. It's forced through Microsoft365 so that it's always there. It's stalled quite a few users though and we need to ensure that the plugin operates all the time.
What problem are you trying to solve?
I use Outlook to manage 14 different email addresses. I run 5 companies and am support and admin for the majority of them. Outlook is the tool used for email as nothing else is comparable. Having multiple signatures and the ability to sort through all of it with 1 application is necessary. Their web version sucks. It's horrible. All of our users have VNC installed and remote into the desktop to utilize the native workstation
What do you like?
It helps natively track emails over to the CRM which is necessary.
What do you dislike?
It really suffers when you have more than 1 HubSpot account as it's tied only to the primary HubSpot. This forces users to end up using either a webversion of a different Outlook or sending emails directly through HubSpot. It could use more robustness.

Looks Great in Theory
The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it. One of the reasons I use it the most is for attaching my meeting link and I find myself copying it directly from HubSpot rather than the integration since it works so infrequently.
What problem are you trying to solve?
External communications (communications with customers/clients/vendors/etc.)
What do you like?
Sometimes it makes it convenient to access items from the Sales tools in HubSpot
What do you dislike?
I (as a Marketer) can't use any of the marketing tools native to HubSpot within outlook.

Request Create Tickets from Email/Add new contacts
Works very well compared to our previous CRM, Microsoft Dynamics. I think there are a few functionalities (as stated above) that could be improved but love the ability to track emails and to create deals and tasks directly from the email.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Our team manages our client partnerships and at times, clients will reach out to request a project or some service (not necessarily a product which would be a Deal) which we would want to create a ticket for in HubSpot. There is already the ability to create tasks and deals but not tickets. Seems like it would be simple to add. The ability to add new contacts right from the email thread rather than only the person who is emailing to you. For example, client contact reaches out to introduce you to new client contact via email. You can't just log that person from the email or toggle between the recipients on the thread but have to go into HubSpot to add that person directly.
What do you like?
Visibility and syncing our communication with external clients to our internal operations.

Not having autonomy over setting Lifecycle Stages when sending to a new email address ruins it
When emailing someone for the first time, if you toggle on the track and log, it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time, not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data, that as far as I can think of right now, means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them, or having to ditch the extension

Es muy rara e incómoda la fórmula para hacer seguimiento de los contactos ya existentes
Lo dicho, una funcionalidad mediocre e incómoda. No quiero trabajar con Outlook, ya que el CRM tiene la gestión de correos, SOLO querría el CRM, y olvidarme de Outlook. Pero no puedo hacerlo porque los nuevos correos de contactos existentes no me llegan. Una decepción.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Outlook sólo la utilizo con la cuenta personal de tareas comerciales. Cuando me llega un mensaje *nuevo* de un *contacto existente*, tener que hacer una redirección a una cuenta de "forward" o de "bcc", quitar lo que no te interesa al hacer la redirección (la cabecera, el RV o RE del asunto), etc, es muy incómodo. Lo suyo sería que, ya que le damos permisos a HubSpot para que acceda a la cuenta de correo, cuando llegase un correo NUEVO de un contacto EXISTENTE, lo metiese directamente en la ficha del contacto en el CRM. Cualquier otra cosa es un despropósito y una molestia.

On the side assistant
Easy installation of plugin, works fast. In my work it is most important to get known unfinished, pending issues, like Sales Order number in system and tracking number for shipment. These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office, it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly. So far, the plugin is not showing all needed information, but helps a lot to jump into customer record. I would recommend to use HubSpot plugin with Outlook.

The only drawback is probably a gap on my part; I'd like to see how I can allocated emails to many contacts. Even if this can't be done though, it's not a deal breaker.

The questions in this survey only names Outlook, is it about the integration with HubSpot? Overall Hubpost is dramatic with Outlook. User unfriendly, sticked in the application and sharing all in HubSpot.

Use Outlook for Daily business, personal and sports e-mail, agenda and contacts. Integration with HubSpot is dramatic, automaticly adds the HubSpot address to all you do. See e.g. Salesforce integration, way more user friendly.

Lack of integration between outlook and HubSpot
Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful, and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said, the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that, Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on, it doesn’t work. So my review is less of HubSpot or Outlook, and more of the integration between the two.

Very satisfied - I have 1 suggestion
This plugin works great, I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool, well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.

When someone I email 10 times a day are all put into the CRM, it makes finding the conversation or information like finding a needle in a haystack.

Needs additional feature for syncing emails without reply
I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However, an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality, like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email, click archive, and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot, as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.

Outlook Inbox Issues
After installing the HubSpot plug-in for Outlook, all of my new/unread emails are showing up as read. There are no resources available to free users. I can't even begin to tell you how frustrating and time consuming it is to see my inbox showing up as unread when I haven't read a single one.

Lacks crucial functionality in terms of deleting processed letters
As you might know, Outlook storage is limited. Many CRMs offer the following functionality: Once Outlook letter is processed (added to Portal/CRM system or sent from Portal/CRM system), the same corresponding letter gets deleted from Outlook mailbox. Check out OTRS functionality, for example. So basically that would be really helpful if you could add this feature to your Outlook integration. If HubSpot will be able to delete processed letters from Outlook mailboxes, that should really help us, your customers.
What problem are you trying to solve?
For Inboxes (Conversations).

No integration for shared inbox
I love Outlook and I was very excited to adopt HubSpot because we were told that it was able to integrate with Outlook, which is one of the major reasons we chose to go with HubSpot as a CRM. However, after purchasing HubSpot, we found that the handy HubSpot tool that is present for personal email accounts does not show up for a shared inbox. Rendering that integration nearly useless for our purposes. After hours of tech calls, we now have to decide to either use the "Conversations" feature in HubSpot as our communication tool exclusively, or continue using Outlook the way we have been, but without using the HubSpot integration tool. My understanding is that the issue is on Microsoft's end, rather than HubSpot's, but we should have been informed of this right away. Deeply disappointing.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Our entire sales team uses a shared Outlook inbox for our daily sales activities.
What do you like?
Outlook is great as a standalone program and if you only use a personal email, the integration should work fine.
What do you dislike?
If you use a shared inbox, it simply will not work the way it does for a personal email box.

While I can use HubSpot in the email itself (when using Chrome or the Outlook App), I haven't gotten to that point with my team.

Now calendar invites are sent with ease, and everything moves along quickly.

Funktioniert gut aber sorgt für Chaos
Die Ablage von gesendeten Mail funktioniert sehr gut und der Zugriff auf Dokumente, Vorlagen und Snippets ist astrein. Abgesehen davon gibt es zwei enorme Schwachstellen, die unten aufgeführt sind, wodurch maximal 5/10 vergeben werden können.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Wir nutzen Outlook für alle vertrieblichen Kommunikationen mit unseren Kunden. Servicetätigkeiten werden direkt über das Postfach in HubSpot bearbeitet
What do you like?
Einfache Nutzung und sehr intuitiv. Das Plug in ist super schnell installiert und einer schnellen Verwendung steht nichts im Wege.
What do you dislike?
1. Bei einem Großteil des Team funktioniert die Adresse zum Weiterleiten nicht, wodurch ausschließlich die Outbound Mails aufgeführt sind und alle Inbound Mails weiterhin in den Postfächern der Vertriebler schlummern. 2. Das mit Abstand größte Problem ist jedoch, dass die Zuordnung ein total Chaos ist und für riesen Frust in der Abteilung sorgt! Während Unternehmen und Kontakte perfekt zu sortiert werden, ist die Zuordnung von Deals und Tickets die reinste Katastrophe. Habe ich bei einem Unternehmen mehrere Deal und Tickets aktiv und nun wird eine von den Sachverhalten unabhängige E-Mail versendet wird diese ALLEN offenen Sachverhalten zugeordnet. Somit habe ich ich jedem Deal des Unternehmens gleichzeitig auch alles Aktivitäten. Evtl. ist das eine Einstellungssache hier konnte bislang jedoch noch niemand Abhilfe schaffen.

Integración con Outlook
En general la aplicación funciona y lo hace de manera adecuada. La integración es sencilla sin llegar a ser espectacular porque te obliga a utilizar HubSpot para interactuar, es decir, si mandas el correo directo desde outlook no tiene el mismo tratamiento. Lo que definitivamente no me agradó y es por lo que dejé de utilizarlo es porque no permite agregar un buzón de cuenta personal, solo general y así cualquiera puede ver todos los correos.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Para dar seguimiento a los correos y llevar una estadística de contacto
What do you like?
Fácil integración, muy intuitivo, genera información valiosa de contacto.
What do you dislike?
No se pueden utilizar cuentas "nombradas", solo generales. No existe el uso desde outlook, te obliga a que lo hagas desde la herramienta.

Useful but...
It is helping us to keep track of what we've said to who, and how often. I wish it was a bit more intelligent - focused just on the one account that I have in my outlook not my personal account too. I also wish I understood a bit more about how it picks up what to track. But generally, considering we've only been using it in our business for last couple of weeks, we're finding it helpful.

Outlook is great. HubSpot plugged into Outlook doesnt work. I have to use Outlook in Edge for it to work correctly. I reported a ticket some time ago and was told this was not a HubSpot issue, it was a problem with Microsoft Outlook. Many new versions of Outlook have been released and it still doesnt work.

Not as good as the Gmail equivalent
There is one feature that is available in Gmail that is not in Outlook. That is the ability to go to an email thread by following a link in the HubSpot activity feed in the same way as you can for Gmail. If I get a notification that 'someone' opened an email I have to search in Outlook to find out who that might be based on the email subject. With the Gmail integration, you just click a link and are taken to the email. Also, it is not very stable. The add-in crashes from time to time and fails to track. If you don't spot this you are sending emails that are not tracked which is not great. If you do spot it you have to restart Outlook to fix.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Day to day business emails
What do you like?
Your emails get added to your client records in the CRM and you can add document, templates and snippets from HubSpot to the emails. You can also track opens
What do you dislike?
It is not as good as the Gmail version, and also not very stable. It also does not activate automatically like the Google version and you have to remember to click the add-in icon and then pin it to Outlook. It would be good if it was opened and pinned by default.

What do you like?
You get to work out of your outlook (where most are more comfortable) vs. the CRM e-mail tool (not as many features). Without thinking your communication with contacts is logged in the CRM. You also get feedback on opens and hyperlink clicks from the tracking pixel in the CRM.
What do you dislike?
Warning, EVERY e-mail you send goes in the CRM. To avoid this, make sure you use that suppression list in your settings to name e-mails you frequently send to (like co-workers). using templates and snippets takes more clicks than in the CRM so I tend to use the CRM e-mail tool for those types of replies.
