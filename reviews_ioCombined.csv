Absolutely disgusting with the treatment I received in the cex shop in Cavan Ireland. Bought a phone here with disabled shortly after purchase. Brought it back to be rudely told they couldn’t do anything that I’d have to bring it to repair shop.did so and man in repair shop told me it was faulty and bring it back to cex and don’t let them fob you off. Went back to cex to be fobbed off. Only by another person who spoke to me like I was a two year old. Again never looked at phone only have me same speech the last lad did. It’s like there trained to do tell the same thing to all. Was absolutely disgusted. These are young people trained to lie. They have not heard the last from me. This shop needs highlighting and should not be allowed rip people off like they do. I say shut them down.

I have given them a 1 star but they deserve a minus 10 never in my life have i ever recieved such service such utter twaddle in my life ! 43 years on this earth and I thought I had heard it all . I purchased a 3ds from the store in cramlington it was easy she got it out I selected a few games she put it in a box and went and got the charger put it in and i paid HAPPY !! Untill I got home the charger was the wrong size and didn't fit I thought easy mistake I'll go back tomorrow and get it swapped by the way £165 I spent !! So I went back explained what had happened thinking they would swap the charger that would be the end no . Why have u got the charger u don't get that u don't buy a device from here and be supplied with a charger not even a wire that's not our policy that's not Nintendo's policy . Nintendo apparently don't supply any means of making the device u have bought work !!! I do not believe this I have previously owned 3 other 3ds s and always had a wire supplied !! They made me feel ridiculous next thing was well u can have a refund but u will have to leave it with us for 1 hr 30 so we can run a diagnostic s check as it's left the store I bought this yesterday st 430 it's now 930 the next day and I haven't got a lead to charge it .. then it will take 3-5 days for the refund our staff member should not have given u a charger !! I asked her about the box leads and warranty she said all included TRAIN YOUR STAFF !!! I feel utterly ridiculous ,spoken to like I'm an idiot and totally disgusted by your staff manner ,customer service and the way they laughed when i left the shop !!! Never ever shop here they take your money laugh at u and make up stupid rules . This ds was bought as a replacement for a disabled mans Christmas present i hope you are ashamed and laughing at that to.

Zoie and Kieran at cex in Milton Keynes made such an effect for me and served me with a smile and patience, I was selling my Xbox series x and they went above and beyond to attend to my needs, bank transfer wasn't good for me and there wasn't much money left in their tills, they still went and checked all the tills to collect the money I needed.
will defiantly recommend this store, great customer service.

I sold in two iPhones because I’m struggling for money, they claimed that the phones where damaged, I had photos of the phones before shipping them to CeX. CeX sent the phones back to me damaged, I made a complaint and they filed a claim with Royal Mail and told me I had to wait 30 days (CeX paid postage so they were legally responsible for what happened to my goods) so I waited and then I get this short email back basically saying they had an outcome with Royal Mail (which means they got paid compensation for my iPhone which they already shipped back to me) instead of giving me the compensation they told me that they will buy the damage phone, so they pocket the compensation of £85 and give me £34.99 so they are pocketing the compensation, trying to give me less and will get the phone fixed and sell it. They are very dishonest and try to scam disabled people like me

Really bad place to shop, the phone I bought became faulty after 8 days and they claimed the fault was caused by me. They have been extremely rude and did not check the phone at all. They offer you guarantee but they will find every excuse not to honor this guarantee. And don't try even to take it with customer service as there is almost non. You can't phone or email them, only fill some online form which does not help as the person who replies is taking immediately the side of the shop without providing any kind of proof to the claims made by the Cex shop manager.
Stay away they don't deserve even the one star, If I could give zero stars I would but unfortunately one star is the lowest grade

Bought a oculus rift s a year ago, took it back under warranty after a technical fault with the head set to be told its void because there is a crack in the hand control.
The staff in particular sam (the store manager apparently) in Guildford branch actually laughed in our face and then slammed the laptop shut and said I refuse you service! Disgusting, left a heart broken 10yr old boy. NEVER will I enter a Cex store ever again.

They have very very bad customer service. They sell faulty goods and state that their warranty does not cover 'customer damage' when in fact the goods they sell are already faulty.
bought some ear pods 27 September 2021 for £60. took them back 3 weeks later and told them left ear bud not working. They did their 'diagnostic' which lasted 10 minutes. They then told me it is working fine. Continued to have problems and took them back (twice within 2 months of purchase).
They then tell me pin is damaged and that their warranty does not cover customer damage. I told them that I hardly used the buds. They were not interested!!!!!
never buy anything from these crooks. Spoke to someone who worked for them. He said they buy items off of people and just put them on display without checking properly.

Hi Simon,

Thank you for your patience.

I have checked with the store and it seems that due to some mixup the AMD Radeon RX 580 was sent to an incorrect address and the other customer's order was sent to your address. I apologise for the inconvenience caused to you.
Feedback has been given to the store that fulfilled the order so that going forward no such instances happen.

Would never buy from cex again. Bought a Samsung tablet in May 2021 with a 24month warrenty, 5months after buying it the screen has got lines on it, taken it back to the Portsmouth branch where we bought it, to be told it has been dropped, we have not dropped it and looking on you tube it is a common problem that a wire has come loose, but have been told we have to pay £60 to get it repaired.
Not only have we been called liars but we have to pay to get it repaired. Totally disguised with the customer service, and the warrenty isn't worth the paper it is printed on.

So I brought a mac book air from cex it had taken me just under 8 months to save up for a second hand laptop. I have had the laptop for less then 4 months and now it has a charging fault. I took it back and now they are saying it damaged. I am so disappointed.i have used my laptop about 4 times over the sapce of 4 months and its always kept save and locked away where no one has acess. I had brought the laptop with some damages on it I am so stupid I should of taken pictures on arrival. I am trying me best to get this resolved I just can't afford to loose £300 it's left me so heartbroken and I just can't believe it.

Took my Fitbit versa in to sell to them- really great condition and they offered me £27.....fair enough so left it there to be tested came back after an hour to be told it was reported lost/ stolen.....U have a receipt from Amazon for it - bought it new in December 2019 so what the hell? I resent being labelled a thief especially in CEX which clearly does buy stuff from dodgy people! I have complained to Head Office and am now selling it elsewhere on line.

Purchased a Nintendo DS for my partner from CEX in KILMARNOCK, after playing she complained that there was a part missing and it wasn’t charging properly. Having only bought it the previous day took it back to the shop with receipt for my money back only to discover that it MUST be put through a “warranty test” to justify my return. After 20 mins or so the staff member assured me the device was okay as he had been “playing it” non stop since i dropped it in ( that’s some extensive warranty test!”) Anyway, with these red flags now raised in my mind i thought it was best that i declined the device and requested my money back. I was utterly outraged when they told me we can’t return you’re money as it’s only an instore voucher we can provide, i thought the bloody cheek, first sell me an item that doesn’t work properly then refuse to hand me back the cash i paid for it eventhough i returned the item within the two day window (confirmed time limit from a member of staff in the IRVINE CEX). I wouldn’t recommend this mob as they falsely advertise their warranty and aren’t willing to budge even with the phrase “the customers always right”. AVOID like the plague of zombies that pollute Kilmarnock burns mall. These jokers are rip off merchants.

Bought a used laptop from Crystal Peaks Sheffield. The 2 year warranty was attractive and I mistakenly trusted they would be decent and honest to deal with. It failed after a few months but CEX would not honour the guarantee. I accept the laptop was bought as 2nd class because of previous owner mishandling but if CEX want to play that game ,don't pretend it has a warranty. Very disappointed with CEX and would advise against using them.

Brought a iPhone SE within a week the screen developed a fault and then went off completely. Took back into store and said about it asked for instore voucher so I could get a replacement and they came back saying I have damaged the scree it’s not covered on the 24 month warranty as it’s classed as accidental damage.. so wasted £360 and a useless phone and CEX staff it’s my fault and should be more careful.
CEX warranty is a complete joke and staff are rude.

Not sure about all the bad reviews on here, never had any issues with my local store and any issues i've run into online (had a couple, been sent the wrong google nest/home model, dirty items) have been quickly dealt with. I suggest contacting CEX through facebook messenger, usually get a reply the same day. Been refunded for items in full quickly and easy when faults have arose, sold to cex in store too and had no issues again.

Frankly I am fed-up with getting damaged DVD's from CEX. Angry with myself just bought another box set, needless to say it's badly damaged. Clearly there quality control is simply just poor.
As for their customer service I concur with other reviewers the best adjective is: terrible. That said I notice they monitor sites like this to leave a: just contact us; let us help: really!
I am attempting to cancel a DVD box set I ordered, once done will be terminating my account. Amazon is where I will buy from.
So angry with myself for buying from them again.

Ordered a laptop from them 20th July 2021. Item was never delivered. I was refused a refund and made to wait until 3rd August as they could not be bothered to chase the order with Royal Mail.
It is now 3rd August, still no laptop, no update, no response to email and no refund.
This company is genuinely not worth dealing with. Customer service is very very poor. There are other sites selling similar products that I will be going to now.
Update 4th August 2021.
After contact from CeX this morning (after this review, no surpise!) they still clearly have not looked into the countless emails I have sent over the last two weeks. Still no meaningful response, no refund and no accountability for their error as they are trying to blame Royal Mail who they subcontract out to so ultimately the responsibility lies with CeX.

I purchased a limited collectors edition box set on Blu-ray which was in a steelbook “breaking bad” what they send me was the regular edition. The limited edition they charged me £22 for, they sent me the £15 regular edition and rather than refund me the difference they insisted I travel an hour away to the post office to return it which would cost me more in travel costs than it’s worth. They don’t care how they treat customers.

Avoid, avoid, avoid. Customer service is simply pathetic in this place. I bought ps4 not long time ago and I asked person who sold me it (Killian) 3 TIMES!!!! is the 24 warranty cover everything including controller. He said yes 3 times. I came back to cex tallagh in Thursday in my only day off to get it fixed with no charging issue and girl told me that my pad is covered only 6 months as policy change during lockdown!!!! I ask for a manager and he said the same looking straight into my eyes!!!! When I went online for complain they told me that the pad IS covered by 2 years and I need to come back with a pad. Told them that I'm not going there as it's a waste of time and I dont drive so I was informed to send someone else or go to different cex in Ireland!!! Becaaue of your fault I need to involve 3rd people into this or go to city centre!!!! Its a joke!!!! Its already week that my issue is not sorted and I'm week without a pad. Lady in customer service keep telling me that I have to go to bring the old pad as otherwise i dont get new one. Really??? Pad cost you about 30 euro and your sales person lie to me about it. They offer me 10 euro to cover my time waste..... 10 euro... that's what a customer is worth for them. I just ask to ship new pad to my home as I already spend nearly 2 hours walking to them and they lie to me by telling shorter period of warranty even talking with manager. Be aware of this company as everything what they are telling could be a lie and small things like pad replacement it's a nightmare for them. I had to contact my solicitor as I can not leave it like that right now.

Purchased an iPhone online about 10 months ago and speakers have suddenly gone. As it had 2 year guarantee I took it back to my local town store Nottingham exchange walk, expected to have a battle as you do with any faulty goods these days but was pleasantly suprised. They tested the phone found the fault and refunded me - still waiting for the payment to clear as was done on a Sunday but the staff were all helpful and polite nothing was an issue and they didn't have a problem checking out what I'd said. So Happy with the service i purchased another phone at the same time whilst waiting for the money to clear! I would recommend and id certainly buy from them again, got the service I always wished every one gave! Thank you!

I bought some Powerbeats in May (Grade B). came in a filthy box and were broken. I couldn’t take back to the store for 2 week due to work but made them aware as soon as the product arrived. I had to travel to a store to return the item and pick up a replacement which had been arranged following my initial Trust Pilot review.
I took them back to the store who could see that they clearly shouldn’t have been dispatched in the condition they were in. The store manager showed me the replacement and embarrassingly informed me the replacement was damaged as well. I was fuming and had no option for a refund.
I made a complaint and Kester was liasing with me. He offered a good will gesture of £10. He then asked me to change my initial review!!!! I didn’t of course and then once the money had been refunded I look to but the Powerbeats again only to see they had increased the price for the same Grade by at least £10. This meant that the £10 voucher was basically non existent! I complained about this and was told I should have purchased the other Powerbeats immediately!!
I replied stating I did and the replacement you ordered for me to collect in the store was again faulty so I left it 2 weeks before deciding to try again!!
Don’t bother buying anything as if everything is correct CeX are great but appalling when things go wrong. The customer service has been none existent. You can’t even speak to anyone and have to do everything by email!

Do not order from this company online. They take payment and only let you know that the item is not in stock if you contact them first. Your refund might be returned eventually if you are lucky. Whatever about the stores, save yourself alot of hassle and try another company online. Personally I would give minus stars as a review.

Booked in for a sale through the website as advised. Took my items to store the same day, store was empty and it took roughly 20 mins for the store clerk to check in my items. This was the quick option apparently.
After 3 days of chasing, after not having no emails, no calls, no response online via Facebook or twitter, I get told my item is broken and they can't accept it, despite being fully working when taken in, yes.. That old chestnut🙄.
Trying to get any sort of customer service quite frankly is like trying to get blood from a stone. The fact that Cex continue to use the pandemic as an excuse for their shocking response times and shocking lack of customer service is not only an insult to all their customers but their staff too.
Go find your local alternative to Cex, they are not the be all and end all and quite frankly there's other stores that would benefit more from your custom on the back end of a pandemic

Recently tried to sell 2 items to CEX to which they have opened from sealed condition and tested to then tell me that there is a 10% reduction for being multiple items.
Despite their terms and conditions stating:

And email stating:
 **Multiple quantities of the same product may be subject to discount. If a discount is applied, we will notify you via email before processing your order.**
Note that in both instances, reference is made to a revised offer being made on receipt, and before processing, not after the items have been opened and tested.
Currently waiting to hear back before I pursue legal action against the company, but this is a clear breach of contract and of their own terms and conditions.
If you're selling to CEX I would highly advise against it as they are scammers.

Past experience not good, took a LG cookie mobile phone to sell a number of years ago, in full working order, testing took a hour or so, came back and they said it was not working. I can say categorically that this phone was working fine....they broke it. Took an Xbox one to sell today, they offered £50.00, no thanks not selling for that, probably break it with there testing...fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.....guy behind counter was not particularly pleasant either.

I’ve had Cex not honour their 2 yr warranty on £225 AirPod pros. Order AL480365. Apple acknowledge the crackling is a manufacturing error and will fix. But CEX say it’s earwax and told me simply to pick up my AirPods. I suspect it’s because they can’t go to Apple to resolve.
This is the difference between me continuing as a loyal Cex customer (I’ve bought various consoles and games previously and am a registered member) and never using again and use Apple / Amazon / eBay etc instead.
I will consider taking to trading standards if it can’t be resolved.
Link where Apple confirm the problem can be easily found - type HT211157

A second hand DVD movie that I bought from the Cex 69 Queensway, Stevenage turned out to be faulty because when loaded onto my Sony dvd harddrive at home showed just a blank screen and no sound. Hope I can get a refund from this bad purchase that I regret having made.

Bought a camera via the webstore, which was shown as in stock. Heard nothing from them regarding the item being shipped for a few days so decided to chase them. Low and behold the camera in stock wasn't available for online purchase (not declared anywhere), by which point my account had already been charged, and the first I heard of this was after chasing them. Their response was essentially we'll refund you over the next 2 weeks. Given they never communicated the issue and are seemingly OK with a 2 week turnaround on refund I'll never be using them again.

I have been absolutely delighted with the service I received from CEX. I bought a laptop about 16 months ago with a 2 year guarantee at a very reasonable price. It has worked very well but during lockdown started to play up a bit so I took it back to the shop in York. They were so very helpful and very happy for me to return it and gave me excellent advice so I could find a replacement. Really they were so very friendly and helpful it was a pleasure. I will definitely shop there again.

I would give it a 0 stars if I could. This company is a joke. My partner bought phone while ago and Royal Mail delivered it to wrong address. Cex said they need to investigate it. We contacted Royal Mail and they confirmed that phone was delivered to wrong address. We been waiting for over a month and they still needed more time. We been advised by CAB to request charge back with bank so that's what we did. Now both our accounts are suspended and they want us to contact solicitors to resolve the issue. At the end of the day it wasn't our fault and we been treated proper unfair. Customer service is disgraceful!!!

Ordered from the UK site using a mail forwarding service in Ireland, only for the order to be cancelled, and my account suspended, they didn’t tell me why until I contacted them. They said I can’t use a mail forwarding service or a card not linked to the UK address, this isn’t stated on the site, and for the card it in fact says the opposite. They also suggested I check a nearby store... during a pandemic... I only used the UK site to begin with because they don’t have the same kind of stock in Ireland. Absolutely appalling service.

They sold me a Macbook Pro classification A (mint condition) for £ 698, when I received the product I noticed one of the keyboard wasn't working properly but it didn't bothered me, after all it is a secondhand product, one year later I noticed that the laptop will get uncharged quickly, and saw a message in the screen saying the battery needed service, I took the laptop to one of the shops in shepherd's Bush at the beginning they didn't want to receive the product, they said I needed to send it by mail to the main office, I insisted and they took the laptop, they said they were checking the state of the laptop it took like 3 weeks and after that they said that the laptop had water damage and that the guarantee doesn't cover it. I never used the laptop out of my house, I never spilled water on it, I have been scammed, this people sell damaged products, don't buy anything from them.

Worst online customer service ever! Brought a PS3 and a load pf games, as well as a PS2 and games. Everything arrived with 3 working days (5 in total as it was the weekend), all except the PS3 console, even though a box with a game in said there was the console in it. Emailed and waited a further 3 days for a response, only to be told it had been sent and i had received it. I had to send a picture of the box it was supposed to arrive in, which was only big enough for the game, and a copy of the invoice. Still had to wait another 2 days for a response. Then im told the store have realised their mistake and send their apologies, and are posting item immediately, with tracking number. Logged into tracking which says next day delivery by 1pm, so im happy. A few days go by and tracking still says royal mail are waiting for item to be sent from store and im told to wait till 23rd Feb. Finally item arrived 10 days after they said they would send out straight away. DO NOT buy online. Its not worth the hassle. Better to wait till the stores are allowed to reopen, or go to a rival, like Game who sent me a gift voucher for £10 because my pre order was delayed by a day in delivery.

It's a PC, how do you lose a thing like that .. it's not a small thing. I'm now 400 quid down for up to 10 days, cannot afford a replacement until then andcannot work until I find a replacement after I get a refund.

Bought a game as a Christmas gift and was really excited about it as the person I wanted to gift it to would have loved it!
The game came before Christmas with not much delay but when opening the package i noticed that the game that was sent to me was a promotional copy only which i find unacceptable.
If it was for my self I probably would not have bothered much as as long as it works it's fine, however this was intended as a gift and i am not about to gift someone with a promotional copy and look cheap.
This are not for resell purposes and selling one of those copies is illegal!
Due to the current pandemic i was not able to meet my Friend and I never even got around to give him this gift ( not that I really wanted to in the end)
i have asked the store near me to exchange it but of course they did not have this item in store and could not do so.
i have finally requested to return the product for a refund and to my surprise they only accept returns for 14 days .
I bought this game at the beginning of December to make sure it got here on time for Christmas so obviously 14 days are not enough for a return!
I would have expected from them a little more consideration due to the current situation especially as everyone else extends their returns during Christmas!
Anyway after emailing to request the return i had an automate reply saying the will get back to me within 48h which did not happen!
i had to wait 10 day for a reply in which they basically said they could not do anything.
i have requested a phone call as i'm working full time and do not have time to keep emailing back and forth and was denied so.
Finally after 1 month emailing back and forth they have said the item would not be refunded.
i have asked multiple times for the item to be exchanged as i understood the refund was not an option but i was denied so.
Nowhere on their website the product was advertised as promotional copy only so i could not have known that would have been the case.
Disgusting customer service and very poor quality.
STAY AWAY !

You guys are selling XBox series X consoles for £630, when they are selling for £449.99 everywhere else. You were obviously snapping up all the stock on launch, preventing fellow gamers from getting their consoles, so you could make £180 on each console you sell. And to think you did that during a pandemic, taking advantage of people. What happened to CEX?

Refusing to send the right purchased online item.
As someone who used to love going to CEX to buy and trade games, I no longer want to give them my money and will advise as many people as possible to run far away from them.
I recently bought a lens from them online. After waiting far too long for it to arrive, when I opened the box I noticed it was the wrong item. CEX does not have a phone number to resolve issues quickly and its email auto reply says it will take 72 hours which is also not true. I have tried contacting them on their Facebook page which took two hours for them to reply.
Instead of saying they will send me what I paid for they have said I need to post it back and wait 1 to 2 weeks to process my return.
How is this level of customer service allowed?
I am sheltering and can't be expected to stand in line at the post office and pay for shipping for something that wasn't my fault. Refusing to send me what I paid for is illegal and I will pursue legal action, avoid buying from them so you don't find yourself in the same position.

Bought an Xbox one just before Christmas and less than a month later it stopped working. Spent ages trying to get in touch with someone. When I finally got a response on Twitter they told me I can’t return it until the stores reopen after lockdown.
I find this unbelievable considering they are still accepting goods and doing click and collect. I explained Im paying a subscription for games pass I can’t use. The customer service agent clearly was just copying and pasting replies and didn’t even get the item correct.
I think it’s disgusting. I know there will be parents who’ve got to explain to their kids they have to wait months and months for a new ones. It’s not on. I luckily just bought a new console but I didn’t want to and I should have been able to get a refund!

Have previously bought two iPads from the store one worked for about three years, the other is still working so we were very happy with the product. Today I have tried to buy an iPad online for my mothers birthday. We live abroad and the delivery address was to her care-home. We had to go through everything including payment details and were then told the order would not be processed because the delivery address was not the same as the address on the credit card. I have never come across this problem before. I had invested more than an hour jumping through their hoops plus given my bank details. I feel this rule regarding addresses should be upfront and clearer before confidential info. Is given. Also very frustrating that you can't deal with anybody on the phone, if it's not an order enquiry you can't even message them as they require the order number before they allow you to move forward. I will never deal with them again. Their customer service is non- existent.

Due to lockdown I was pleasantly surprised that I was still able to trade in items at CEX Newmarket. I requested online and was told to drop and go at the store. Upon arrival I knocked on the shutter as requested only to hear a voice from behind shouting is it drop and go? When I answered, the shutter was raised and a very rude employee called Justin aggressively shouted whats your order number. I replied and he told me put the three items on the table, no please no thank and no courtesy. When asked how long to check them, he rudely replied, As long as it takes! This is the second time during both lockdown I have dealt with him and both times he was rude, unhelpful and irritated that I dared to interrupt his day!

I ordered 2 games from their website using one of their own credit vouchers. A week or so later, the first game arrived in a very thin parcel which definitely only contained 1 game as there would not have been room for any more. I did not think this was unusual, as their own website stated that games may be dispatched separately as they may come from different stores. However, after a few more weeks when the second game did not arrive, I chased it with CEX (something I was only able to do via their website/email as they have no customer service telephone number to speak of). Initially a handler named Doris responded very helpfully that she would chase this up with the store responsible for dispatching the games, however, the subsequent emails quickly turned accusatory with phrases like As you claim you haven't received one game and the store has confirmed that both the items were sent in the same parcel.
The handler seemed fixated on the condition of the original packaging that the first game came in, which i confirmed i had since thrown away as i expected the 2nd game to follow separately but was in perfectly fine condition. The handler was also extremely reluctant to escalate this to a manager, instead attempting to pacify me by stating she would pass it to the central team to investigate repeatedly. When I was finally able to deal with a manager (again by email only) an individual named Cheryl repeated the previous statements of Doris affirming that the store said they sent 2 and, if i don't have any pictures of the original packaging, then they can't help me any further. I feel the way I've been treated by this organisation is disgusting and I don't know how they expect me to prove that I didn't receive a game. Surely the onus is on them to prove that they sent the game, however, they have declined to provide any evidence of this or even explain what checks were made.
I have been repeatedly made to feel like a liar who is trying to get a free game and clearly this company are much more inclined to believe their employees over paying customers. This company has made querying this issue, and complaining, as difficult as they possibly can and it has had a serious impact on my mental health. I wouldn't reccommend anyone order anything from this website.

Dishonest !! We purchased a MacBook Pro online with a 2-year warranty, when it arrived it had a dent on the side but it was grade B we knew it could have cosmetic damage. Now, after only 5 months, the computer is unusable because only lines appear on the screen and it cannot be turned on. We went to the in-store service center and they refused to help us, despite the warranty, because they blame us for the damage. We pointed out that it had already been delivered to us with the damage and they replied that it is not true because the photos they have in the archive do not show the damage ... we then asked to see them and the photo they had was of a computer taken by high and there were no pictures of the edges, so it is impossible to see it. We then turned to online assistance and they answered the same thing. Dishonest !! Why didn't they photograph all the parts of the computer before sending it? Be careful, don't buy from them! They promise you a guarantee that doesn't exist.

Sold some items at CEX Wood Green drop off. Staff we're friendly enough and all but the final (and major valuable item, a pc) were sorted.
This is where it ended in terms of quality customer service and the CEX has some serious structural issues on how they run things. So apparently the front ports on the PC didn't work (I assume they mean the USB ports- I could never tell because I never actually spoke to the team in the store) which is unusual because the item I dropped off worked fine and is new this year. Red flag one (have they damaged it?). Red flag two is you cannot contact CEX stores directly, it's pure autism but what it means is I spent TWO WEEKS going back and forth with a middle man, missing calls, etc.
This made it very hard for me to help the team in London on what I'm assuming is an easy fix or a mistake (I hope so or they owe me alot of money).
The final straw is, despite their policy online, they point blank refuse to return this item via post (there is no way given the circumstances I'm able to get back into a tier 4 London even if I pay for it)
So essentially I have zero way of verifying these claims and zero way of getting my £500+ item back any time soon.
Let's suppose this minor issue WAS true ; they refuse to take the parts that DO work.. essentially what I would do is go in store, take it apart in front of them and sell the parts, which are all functional and essentially brand new. Or just take it to another CEX store. Please note I'm not a layman or.l someone who can be taken for a ride; I build PCs for a living and it's incredibly frustrating that they are doing this pathetic computer says no moment which is probably no fault of their own, but another policy.
Now assuming this isn't the fault of the team in wood green (still a little suspicious) then the only issues lie with how CEX is run. The senior management needs to look into this and how communication between the customer and the teams are made and how products are handled and returned because this once great company is going to go down the pan if their not careful, the high street is dying and you cannot afford to have sh**t systems in 2020..
The worst case scenario here is they have
1) damaged an expensive item of mine
2) refuse to communicate directly with me
3) refuse to post it to me
4) I can't get into London any time soon, maybe months,
5) if I do I risk my health
6) also refuse to simply take it apart and sell it assuming it was true (a 5 min job)
Given this experience I would say avoid CEX and just go to local computer store.

I've been using Cex since the first store opened in Birmingham in the nineties. They used to give a fair price for trade-ins. Now they just want to help the scalpers by charging £815 for a Ps5 and give you a terrible price for a week old game. Shame I'll be stopping using them after twenty five years. Also the staff are very unprofessional now in most stores. They hate if you have more than one item to trade in as it involves doing some work. Terrible all around.

I purchased a cd game for my son. On Inspecting the disc I enquired about the marks on the cd whilst the sales assistant was there. I then requested for the disc to be cleaned as in the past I have had a bad experience with products I had purchased from CEX and wanted to make sure that all is as best as it can be especially with Xmas next week. The manager was Incredibly rude in his response by refusing to clean the disc to put my mind at ease, refused to engaged in dialogue even though myself or my brother had not on any occasion raised our voice or altered our tone. Then continued to belittle me infront of other customers and walked away saying he does not have to help, or talk to us as he is now on his lunch. I said that I would wait and he said go on then, you'll be waiting for a full hour. Infact, he was not on his lunch, he went to do something else behind the service counter. This level of unprovoked disrespect was unacceptable. When i mentioned that I would be formalising a complaint against him he showed little to no care so clearly who ever the area manager is has no authority here or the company supports disrespecting customers. We left frustrated and furious and As sivalised people, we weren't able to express our anger. This company has no clear formal complaints channels regarding this king of abuse so I had to go through resolver. I will be taking this as far as I can including negative google reviews and contacting the local press as I have witnesses.

Price is ok.
Condition of goods vary.
Staff are most particular when trading in, however condition of goods are usually poor. Unsure why.
For example:- £40 paid for The SkyWalker Saga, and the majority of discs are badly scratched.
You pay less than 30% for good traded in which is a joke anyhow.
Boscombe branch in Dorset is one to avoid. The staff are incredibly rude.

I did their “drop” and sell on line. Worked perfectly. They confirmed price by email within an hour of dropping and money was in my bank account the next working day. On top of all this, they paid my a lot more than the other online companies who buy iPhones. So would definitely recommend CeX.

Dont sell your items here. They will rip you off. They wanted to buy my almost like new PS4 Pro 1TB for £90. I managed to sell it on Facebook marketplace for £250. If I had sold it to CEX, they would have sold it for £250+ and flipped a profit. Poor customer service and a complete scam. I hope they go out of business sooner than later.
Also what a trashy name... fitting for the company directors who scalp the their customers.

Bought 2 phones online and had to return both , the first phone was locked to EE but clearly marked as unlocked , the staff at the local store were helpful but the managers first reaction was it's a stolen phone and had been locked. Took a week to get the money back. I stupidly decide that this may have been a one off and ordered a second phone online again as the store has limited stock. Turned up as a bgraded phone but looks like it's been kicked down the street ,more than 20 scratches on the main screen. Returned and won't be crossing the stores threshold again!!!

I bought an item online nearly two weeks ago and CeX sent me the wrong one. Also, the item they sent was broken and had wires hanging out from everywhere. Now its nearly two weeks since I returned and I am fighting to get my money back or any decent reply from CeX. Also, don't bother contacting the company director to complain, as he will not reply. STAY AWAY FROM CEX.

From start to finish have found them to be appalling. Had over 100 phones to trade in (Old company phones) 90 of these were in good working order with little damage other than the odd scratch mark. Dropped them off at the store and was met by the most ignorant man Ive ever met who made a massive deal about me leave that volume of phones (Did he not want money for reselling them?) Told me could take 6 weeks or more. No problem given everything going on at the moment. Less that a week later I received 3 calls back to back from a private number, which for obvious reasons I don't answer, way to many scams going on. I get a very threatning voicemail left stating if I do not answer my phone immediately they will not process my order and ill loose the phones. After listening to it again 5 times I eventually deceiver the number I have to call and when I get on the phone he tells me that ALL the phones are rubbish and they are not a recycling center. When I questioned this and how its possible as many were used for only a few months and in good condition, he proceeds to tell me there is battery damage and broken screens. This is untrue as I got rid of all phones that wouldn't turn on or had cracked screens before we packaged them up to go to CEX. He then told me that all he is willing to give me is 12 euro for 4 Iphone 5c's. Absolute joke and he is an absolute cowboy. Will be lodging a formal complaint with CEX as the customer service was appalling. Run a mile!

No customer service whatsoever at your Braintree store.

cex as a company are scam artist's, they over charge on consoles and don't give hardly anything for trade in. they also have a charge of £1.95 per item that they sell.
the company is also selling the new ps5 for roughly £150 more than its price new elsewhere which is £449.99, I have had horrible experiences with them including trying to trade something I brought from them back in for them to then turn around and say they cant take it.

Wish I'd read these reviews before my poor experience with CEX. Strange how many of these reviews are negative and on the CEX site, they are positive with higher ratings!
Went onto the CEX website, put in the details of the phones I wished to sell, received a fair price and took the phones to the nearest shop. All phones in good condition, some in original boxes, and with chargers.
A week later received an email to say they could not accept the phones due to all of them having physical damage. When I queried this and pointed out all phones were in good condition, they changed it to did not pass the test. Have collected the phones from the store now but staff could not, and still cannot explain what this means.
Best not to use CEX.

Purchased an Xbox One X console from CEX, however upon delivery the disc drive would not play standard DVDs. I returned this via their online returns address as advised to by Ramson however upon inspection they have chosen to completely ignore the fault and send me the console back saying they Could not verify the fault. If they had put any DVD in the disc drive, the fault would have been incredibly apparent so it is clear this was not done.
They are in breech of consumer rights when returning electronic goods and in breech of their own return policy.

Sellers are young people who do not know anything about the product that is in the store and cannot explain or advise anything if you have a question about the product.
If you want to buy a game console, controller, or other expensive electronic device, then when you buy you are not shown anything and sold without any checks. Before the sale, they say that everything can be solved under the store's guarantee, but a return can be made only within 2 days, which violates the law, it seems to me.
When returning any goods, except for video or game discs, they take time to check in all ways they try to refuse a replacement or refund for a low-quality product.
If you sell your things to this store, then they are priced at the lowest rate. The amount that is offered to you in the store is below the lowest rate on their website.
They are just scammers and crooks.

I went to Cex to get my Xbox One repaired, they sent off the unit, advised it was working, I collected it and it wasn't working (£55 paid). I returned it to the store who confirmed it wasn't working and they sent it to the repair team again, it was 'repaired' and returned. I got the store to test this before I left and it wasn't working. This is now in the complaints process, however the incompetence level is staggering, it is made worse by the fact I asked Customer services to 'double' check the repair (second time) before returning it. Which they assured me they had done. (Clearly not). The customer service team are adamant the unit is working and the store (same company by the way) have checked to evidence it is not working. I asked the matter to be referred as a customer complaint (but this was not done), I have re-initiated this as a complaint and the store and the repair centre are trying to work out if the unit is broken or not. (As a non-engineer) I have plugged it in and there is no on light to show it is on (my money is on it being broken). Cex responded to this saying it was being sorted (it wasn't) and I have had to liase between the shop and the repair team. An update Cex fans, the repair team claim it is fixed and returned it for the third time...you guessed it. Not working, shambles. I should point out that the third party repair company is Remedy Tech Centre Ltd. Final update, I purchased a new power lead at the Xbox worked. The Tech team returned it not work for a third time advising no repair possible. I have complained and now they have listed some (repairs) they claim so to justify taking my money. My compliant has been rejected. I only hope the Managing Director of CEX recognises the Customer service failings. This company are truly appalling. I think I will start to copy and paste this review to a new place every day. In simple terms, taken in three times returned three times broken and charged for the privilege.

I sold my sons iPhone 6s on the basis of it working, but had scratches... was offered a decent amount of money.
However when the phone was dropped off at the store they changed this classification and deemed that the camera had a scratch, and was therefore not working.
They left a voicemail offering £20 for an iPhone 6s.... upon speaking to their customer service team they have revised this offer to £15 as they made an error on the memory size of the phone.

They are now making up all sorts of things that they have not told me when they directed me to customer services, as reasons why the console is not in 'boxed' condition - even when googling each new thing I've found out from the grapevine were present on new consoles (my console is a day1 console)

I lost my money through three hyper yielding investment platforms whose companies were registered in London, UK. They claimed to have registered their companies in the US as well. The three companies are Moni-Finex (Moni-Finex Global), HybridReserve and InclusiveFx (Inclusive Services).
Moni Finex’s webpages have been inactive since the beginning of August and I have been unable to withdraw since July 12 2019 The MF migrated July 25 2019 to MoniFinex Mining, again unable to withdraw. The sites posted they were performing an internal audit during the month of August 2019; subsequently, it announced the systems were being upgraded since early August. All official Chat-rooms at Telegram, WhatsApp and Facebook are now disabled and some vanished altogether. I Contacted the CEO via WhatsApp, he did not read my notes or respond.
HybridReserve would keep promising mouth watering ROI to lure you in showing you simulated trades and it is almost impossible for you to make a withdrawal. One excuse after the other. That’s when it became crystal clear that I have been scammed of my hard earned money.
My total lost with these three companies was USD532,876.21 as of August 1, 2019. I needed a major portion of this balance to pay off the down-liners who were threatening to file charges for misleading as well as fraud. Their combined balance is approximately USD600,000. A top wealth recovery company in the US brilliantly helped recoup 92% of my lost capital to these fraud companies all within a 2 week period. I can’t thank you guys at RECOVERYWEALTHNOW360 at g mail d o t c o m enough . I am typing this with tears rolling down my cheeks! Please stay away from HYPER YIELDING INVESTMENT PLATFORMS to avoid the agony and pain I went through!

The display was not working fine and gave it to the store for repairing.
Now i am waiting since almost a month and yet there is no reply from the store / service centre.
They are saying that they dont have the part and hence it is taking longer. Why should a customer suffer for their incapability to source the part.
Since last few days, they have stopped picking my calls, not answering my msg over whats app / email.
Very poor after sales support. I am very dissatisfied with the approach and behavior of the staff at the store.

As 8ts over £100 value cex want me to pay for return insured postage. Then claim the postage back by cheque. I'm not convinced with their customer service and so don't trust them to send timely cheque. Plus, who uses cheques now?! I'd have to drive into town, park, get mask on, visit bank to pay it in.

Sold a faulty product and blamed for the damage.
On September 1st I purchased a huawei p20 from the Norwich store. It hadn't been set up for long before I noticed battery issues, sound issues, and soon after that I was in a phone call (struggling to hear so I looked at the bottom of the phone) and noticed a red water indicator meaning the phone was sold with water damage. The phone had been in my pocket since getting this. I was planning on 48hr returning this for a better phone anyway as this store had a poor selection and my local store had agreed to allow me to order a different phone online before refunding the huawei so I wouldn't be without a phone.
Now I've worked for this company for 5 years total and I have experienced firsthand
1) staff making honest mistakes, which does happen.
2) staff ticking boxes on receipts they couldn't fully test (not enough signal to make a call, water indicator not visible, etc)
3) staff members blaming customers for damaging their phones knowing full well these mistakes did sometimes occur
Yet CeX are denying the possibility that a staff member made a mistake in this instance and essentially, I am being blamed. Funnily enough the pocket on my trackies is dry. I have seen a shocking amount of first hand accounts of others being sold faulty products and being blamed for it, as cex have a little tick box saying a product was tested completely and customers have no protection as they do not have evidence.
Thanks to cex I am now stuck with a broken phone and I have to return the phone ordered from cex online even though its over double the value of this one and also the one I've wanted for a really long time. I now cannot afford it again and after spending thousands over the years here I have now lost every bit of trust I had in this company. They reel you in with 2 years warranty but play customers like this. Will not ever be shopping here again, I have more trust in Facebook marketplace sellers.

I sent some items to CeX to sell and received a credit for them.
I decided to use the credit for three items.
Immediately after dispatch I received a notification that one item was not available and received a refund.
I received an empty envelope from CeX. No items or even and delivery note for the items.
I contacted the customer support sending photos of what was received and received a reply that they were investigating.
After three weeks I had got no further so posted a review on another review website. After posting this review the issue was immediately resolved. They claim the store fulfilling the order sent the items and as I received a sealed envelope I was not eligible for a refund. So I loose the £45 from the order and have another £45 in a company I no longer trust to fulfil my order.

I took a phone to cash in which was near perfect. They would not take it because it rocked was the exact words also the price they offered was £43 even the c grade on their website price is £44 cash. This item was at least b grade £49. So there is a major discrepancy between what is offered when you go into store and website which needs to be fixed. I then took it to game who have me more and said it was in really good condition. Unfortunately it seems cex don't want items of will low ball offer you.

They sold a faulty product. Reported issue to them before end of warranty but I couldn't go in-store due to lockdown. They state that they extended it for 2 weeks as 'that was how long lockdown was' and that me not being able to use a different hidden form on their desktop website is why I couldn't find out about it. Their website sucks, even if their stores are okay, the product warranty is a lie. You can tell no UX design was put into the website.

I had decided to upgrade my cell phone and looked at the CEX reviews and decided to visit the Solihull branch. On the web site they advertise iphone 6s trade in for one of their phones around the £110 mark. I had just had a brand new screen fitted to my iphone 6s unlocked the day before. In the branch I was offered £15 for my phone against one of their phones.
The whole advertisement and trade in seems like one big long con job. I would have expected a realistic trade in offer not something which would have covered my petrol to the branch and back

I never shop at CeX due to how overpriced everything is, but the Clinic for console repairs seemed like it could be a great service, until I actually used it of course
After finding them through their website, and everything looking like what I needed, I went in store where I was told they weren't actually running the Clinic service whatsoever, even after emailing them before going! I had to email them to get them to put up a banner on their website to actually tell people they aren't operating, and so I would know when they were open again
When they finally opened, weeks later, I took my device in. I explained exactly what the problem was and the repair I needed doing, filled out their forms and gave them my console
They started working on my device days later than claimed due to nobody at the store sending it for a while if the tracking information is to be believed. A few hours later, they messaged to say they couldn't repair it and they're sending it back to the store. Which was infuriating. I had told them exactly what the issue is and yet only later they decided to say we don't fix that issue, something they could have even told me weeks before and not wasted my time, but, it gets even worse...
It turns out they opened the device, breaking the manufacturers seal and replaced a completely irrelevant part that was working, which, due to the nature of it, now cannot be tested because my device is still broken. Them doing this needlessly has limited my warranty for a repair with other companies due to general policy, but, it gets even worse...
After receiving a message that my console was in store, I went in to collect it. Not sure why I expected more from them, but their incompetence shone through and they couldn't find my console. It wasn't there. So, after contacting support again they located the console and only due to me asking, agreed to courier it back to me instead of requiring a fourth trip to their store, 25 minutes away from me. I would assume this free courier back was an attempt to take some responsibility for their incompetence
I cannot recommend them for their store prices, and unfortunately can only recommend staying away from their Clinic repair service due to the risk of wasting your time and energy trying to deal with them. Just awful

Melissa from Harrow branch of CeX was exceptionally polite and patient. She smiled and was very friendly all through. She made customer service a great experience and made us fall in love with CeX. We will definitely visit Cex again and again for purchases and other transactions because of Melissa's excellent customer service. Thumbs up to Melissa at the Harrow branch of CeX.

Sold my PS3 games for an agreed price of £18.70 but received £14.70 for them, without any explanation as to why the amount received was £4 less than the agreed sum. All games were present and in good order. If had realised that this was going to be the case I might have sold them to Gamexchange for £17.47. If the agreed price could not have been met, Cex should have informed me of the lower price offered before completing the transaction. £18.00 would have been the minimum acceptable by me from Cex. I will be looking at the contact in terms and condition concerning lower offers and non authorisation from the vendor before contacting the regulators and trading standards.

Yesterday we sold numerous items to CeX in Scarborough, including a really good condition iPad Pro. CeX valued these at £569 and were happy to take them. They told us they can only pay via fast bank transfer (which was reluctantly agreed to by us). They assured us this would be completed by today (Wednesday, 5th August 2020), at the very latest. Surprise, surprise, we now have no money and they have our expensive items. They’ve even fully tested these items and acknowledged via email, that they are all great.
So today we try and solve this and get the money owed - well, you can’t contact them via their switchboard phone number conveniently! No direct store phone numbers either. FaceBook messenger - also unanswered! Website contact form - you guessed it, unanswered! My wife had to trail after work to one of their stores, just to try and find out what was going on. It just got quickly fobbed off on their payment processor WorldPay! Heard this excuse a few times before! However, their paperwork actually says “via faster payment” - which is virtually instant through banks these days.
Simply put... they have our items, we have zero money and they don’t seem too fussed at all about helping us now.
We have had zero issues with them in the past, we sell our old unused items and they pay cash. But this new experience has left us extemely sour. Instead of promising the “money will be with us same day, next day at the very latest”, why not just be truthful. Saves this kind of awful scenario for your customers.
I now have zero idea when we are getting the money owed to us, the store is basically saying “wait and see” - this is a disgusting business practice and not acceptable. I would very strongly suggest not selling your own items to CeX, especially if you expect them to honour what they say, or you value honesty, trust and support! There is no reason for them not to have paid by now! Not in the age of fast payments. Once they have your items, you are totally at their mercy. Be warned!

Appalling!!
Bought online what was described as a grade B Xperia XA2 Ultra Dual sim. It arrived with numerous scratches, dirty, not reset & with 2 sim cards still in it..... And guess what, moments after turning it on I started receiving text messages for the previous owner.
Customer support very poor, at one point they began to accuse me of lying about the sim cards... A bit odd being as I sent them pictures within a couple of minutes of opening it.
Took about 4 weeks to finally get a refund even though the phone was returned immediately. Got the impression that the person in customer service who was emailing me had absolutely no interest whatsoever. An appalling experience & will not be using CEX again.

One order cancelled after 4 days, other order cancelled after 3 days. You know how CeX works? After item purchased online, they waiting another 3,4,5 days to see if the same item would be sold in store. If sold in store, they'll cancel online order. If not sold in store in 3,4,5 days, they'll dispatch the item to the ydiot bought it online. In that case this is not a serious company. Think that someone bought an item from you, after that your customer can lose auction or other similar items from other platforms, then, surprise : your order from CeX has been cancelled after 3,4,5 days. If sold in store, take it down from website. If sold online, don't continue to display the item in store for another few days. Again, this is not serious company. Last order number cancelled 8220117

Posted this on CEX site to inform future customer of potential 2 Year guarantee failures. I expect it will be moderated off their reviews site.
Just hope you never need to use the 2 year guarantee. My daughter bought one because I was under the impression that the company would honour the said guarantee but I was wrong. After about a year the computer failed to boot. I took it to our local store where they said they would check it over. A few days later I had a phone call telling me that the computer had liquid damage and a cracked battery fixing that the store manager said was not present at the time of sale because he checked the initial buy in inspection report. Unfortunately this information is not available to customers in the form of photographic evidence, I suspect that the shop who bought it in just did a tick box job and wiped the computer over and no such checks were ever carried out. I was fuming as I was unable to prove that any of what I was told was accurate and correct, all I can say is that I am aware that Macs have liquid indicators on the logic board and they can slowly change colour with mild humidity over a long period of time. I took the computer to an independent mac repair specialist and on opening it they found NO sign of liquid damage, and the plastic clip fracture which was securing the battery I was told was a common issue with the heat which is generated in this component and not someone poking about.
The repairer tried changing some of the chips on the board but this still failed to resolve the issue. We settled for a replacement logic board at the cost of £180. The computer is now fine.
I was going to take the company through the small claims court but I was sick to the back teeth with their sharp unverifiable get out of warranty claims practice and didn't want to push up my blood pressure dealing with them.
Looking back I should have insisted that the computer be opened up in front of me and show me where this damage was and along with the so called buy in inspection report but these checks are done in the shops own time while you are out of the way.
The Mac engineer that fixed it for me told me that he had tried to sell a laptop to CEX that he had stripped and cleaned and checked that it was all OK. When he went back to check for their buying offer price they told him that a USB port was physically damaged and that the computer was not worth much. He knew that the computer was in perfect condition when he gave it to them but couldn't prove it. Why would you expect to need to have photographic evidence. I'll leave to conclusions up to you but I know who I believe.
I hope you Macbook has a long and happy life but be VERY VERY AWARE if you have a problem with it and expect some sort of warranty redress.
Have a look at the comments on the Internet about this company, you will find many people experiencing the same sort of sharp practice as I received.
I for one will NEVER NEVER NEVER have anything to do with this company again
On posting this reply I tried to use the nickname Mr Unhappy but the system said it was already used .... what can I say!!!

I bought a smartwatch. It was second hand and I was assured it was a good price and that I would pay much more for a new one.
I was lied to. In fact they had charged the same price as a brand new watch!
To add to my distress, the watch was faulty and still had someone else's data. I have made 2 return visits to the store to be told I had to wait until they had  tested the watch. I am still waiting for the refund I am entitled to.

So I’m currently experiencing an extremely frustrating issue with CEX.
I sold them an Xbox one with 12 or so games, reaching a price of almost £200.
I waited nearly 3 weeks for a reply from them, only to be told that they need personal information from me (E.G. my phone password, my PC login info, my network password, etc.)
I sent them a email to ask why they need all of this personal info as I factory reset my xbox, and I’ve heard nothing back since. I know there’s less staff working due to COVID, but this is ridiculous
I needed this money two weeks ago, but thanks for messing me around CEX, I’ll be sure to take my business elsewhere next time. Selling and Buying.

They don't even deserve half a star. I Went down to buy Doctor Sleep 2 disc bluray + UHD for £25 which contains an extended directors cut on the second disc so asked to look at the discs and it was the normal edition with 1 disc and 1 UHD. They had this in HMV new for £14.99 and also at zavvi. They blamed it on the seller and said thats how they got it but the tray was only for the 2 disc so it was obvious they was just trying to sell it off as the rare limited version. It still remains listed on the site as well so they are still trying to sell it. Ive also had problems in the past with photo copied covers and missing booklets which was printed on the cover that it contained. I always double make sure of everything if I ever buy from them but really they are to be avoided.

It was locked to an iCloud account and unusable and they just said we checked it so no. It's obvious they did not check it before they sold it and I'm out of pocket. They are not a ligit company, more like a criminal outfit.

Ripping customers off with cash sale prices, buy a DVD from you 3.00, sell for 10.00, buy a DVD from you for 0.01 (yes really), sell for 2.50.. I understand they have operating costs and profit, but never used to be this bad, in the past they would buy a DVD at 4.00 and sell for 6.00 for example. Be wary and check the sale price, often they are the same or more than a new one!. Ripping customers off both ends.. Just saw they buy an iphone for 117 and sell for 235.00. Come on.

I sent a mobile phone which was in pristine condition and perfect working order but they claimed it had a cracked case and classified it as non-working. The value was thus reduced from £15 to 1p. It was sent well-packed so unless it suffered very rough treatment and had arrived in damaged packaging which would have been claimable against Royal Mail I do not understand their response. Beware!

They no longer seem to be checking whether items are in good condition or even work properly when buying things from people.
We've purchased two very expensive Xbox One controllers and they've both been faulty/damaged/missing original pieces.
Customer services have no connection to the people sending things out.
If you can inspect the item in store then that might work, but ordering online from them is a raffle.

Sent an Xbox one off with some games to sell ( was using the voucher and paying and extra 30 to upgrade to Xbox one s)
Took 4 weeks and multiple emails to finally get my voucher. I knew I’d have to wait due to covid, but was quoted 2 weeks by the lady at customer service.
In a rush ordered the wrong item, the Xbox itself was perfect but didn’t come with the original controller. So I emailed and asked if I could just pay the difference in package price and send the controller back for the proper one to be sent out.....
You would of thought I had asked for them to sign the business over to me, I was meet with the policy wall. I tried explaining it seemed very anti-productive to send the whole order back (wait another 4 weeks?) to re order the correct package. But no one seemed to understand this or just didn’t care.
Tried to complain but the ‘manager’ was even more useless and seemed to give less of a s**t than others I spoke to.
Have decided to speak to ombudsman and will not be using Cex again.

MUY MUY MUY DECEPCIONANTE EXPERIENCIA…
MUY MUY MUY DECEPCIONANTE EXPERIENCIA CON CeX España. Impactante.
Los auriculares comprados de CeX en Cádiz para mi iPhone 7 cuestan 15 euros y luego, un par de semanas después, dejaron de funcionar debido a daños internos.
Regresé a la tienda para quejarme, luego los auriculares originales se cambiaron por auriculares muy viejos que cuestan 12 euros, después de un día o dos me di cuenta de que los auriculares que obtuve de la tienda a cambio eran de muy mala calidad, así que pregunté en la tienda muchas veces y contacté a la oficina central para obtener otro reemplazo o me devolvieron mi dinero (15 euros) y luego la sede confirmó por escrito por correo electrónico que los auriculares que tengo ahora (una vez reemplazados) están en garantía y puedo reemplazarlos nuevamente, pero no pasó nada y la tienda así La sede central de CeX está tratando de convencerme de que esté contento con lo que han reemplazado independientemente de mi satisfacción. De hecho, me dijeron que me están haciendo un favor incluso si soy cliente y estoy comprando con dinero propio, pero eso no significa nada para CeX, ya que comprar en la tienda es un favor para mí. Impactante de nuevo.
Se han negado a devolverme mi dinero o reemplazar los auriculares, incluso bajo garantía.
Si este no es el peor servicio al cliente en el planeta, entonces no sé qué es.

Item bought: Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus 128GB Lilac Purple, EE B
Returned and replaced due to severe screen burn in
Unfortunately I had to return due to severe screen burn in. Half of the screen was permanently shaded purple and included features of a WhatsApp messenger screen at the top and bottom. I returned it and was fully refunded for the item and my postage cost. I used Royal Mail Special Delivery as the value was over £100 and was later refunded by cheque.
I then ordered another similar item of the same Grade B category and am happy with the condition and quality.
It was a lot of hassle but I'm satisfied to have been refunded. I suggest checking the quality of the screen thoroughly when you receive an order.

In April I sent my I phone 8 to C ex after getting an estimate of £208 as it was in mint condition and had never been used without a case and protector screen. After a week contacted them and was told that the phone was being regraded and the offer was now £133 without an explanation. After enquiring was told that there were deep scratches of the face of the phone. I told them that that was not possible as I had taken a picture of the phone before sending it and it showed no damage. The tried to say their engineers were trained and would not damage a phone and suggested it may have occurred in transit. I had packed the phone in two separate boxes and there is no way that would occur. They asked for photos of the phone which I gave them and after e mails back and forward they now ask again for photos and are clearly delaying matters. I have informed them I will contact trading standards and the police re damage to my property. I have since had to sell the phone at a large loss as there is a scratch on the screen. Do not deal with this crowd.

Totally get that you are working with less staff but why not close orders so you can cope? At the moment you are buying and selling and getting inundated making a pretty poor experience for everyone involved.
It's totally unacceptable to keep taking in orders and trades with no ability to actually complete these in a reasonable and quoted time frame, They are now saying payment will slip from 7 to 14 to 21 days and even then I'm not convinced. ZERO warning on website.
This seems more like a cash flow issue than a staffing issue. They never 'test' games in store just check and pay. I fear they may be struggling for for-fill payments hence delays.
Support only responded as I called them out on Twitter.
In short: Slow Service Poor Customer Service Wont use again and COVID19 excuses only go so far

Game console arrived broken.
I bought a playstation 2 from CEX online. When it arrived it was rattling and the CD tray was completely stuck closed. The power turned on, aswell as the indicator light for the eject button and the sound of the fan. But the CD tray would not open, so I opened up the system and heard alot of rattling. A few random pieces fell out when I turned it upside down thinking it was a loose screw. But bits of plastic and a brittle piece of putty fell out. I instantly e-mailed CEX for an answer, refund or replacement. (i'd prefer a replacement as I've just bought 10 ps2 games to play) I heard a cookie cutter response and have been told to wait and wait and wait. All I did was purchase a console online and I received a useless lump of plastic and metal which is no good to anyone andpaid for it.
I wanted to see if they'd help out but it's been a couple of weeks with only the advice to wait for a response. That's not the approach you'd take if it were the other way around, I am sure of it.
I didn't want to leave a bad review as it's not normally my style but this service and lack of a resolution is not acceptable and I want to let others know.

I wish I had read some reviews before I brought from these. I took lots of items into Cex for my 11yr old son as he want to save for gaming pc which we were going to buy privately. We had £214 for goods. Staff asked son what he was going to spend money on he said gaming pc. How do i wish we never had that conversation! So long story short we went by the staffs advice and ordered one. Son so happy when it arrived untill we opened box! Which was a bog standard office pc! I was not happy. Took straight back to Cex all I wanted was a refund but as we paid in voucher as was talked into buying from them we couldn't have one even though I was told this was a gaming pc so I had no chose but to add another £220 towards another where I was told was a gaming pc this time but was coming from another shop and being delivered! When arrived son was happy excited even though it wasn't in best of condition even though grade B! 8wks down line the line pc won't update won't reset and has black screen when try any! Been in contact with Microsoft done everything they told us but still don't work. So I'm not happy to say the least and son well he is heart broken and has not gaming pc that works in this period of current lockdown. Sent email to CEX yesterday stating I want a full refund and pick up of this unsable pc. Will keep you updated on answer. Very very disappointed customer.

I bought a phone for $770 iPhone from CeX. Then I returned to my place of residence in remote NSW. I discovered that basic features on the phone did not work: earpiece speaker & all location services. Then the coronavirus lockdown began. CeX customer support refused to let me post the phone back to the store--a three hour drive away--demanding that because I bought it instore, I would have to return it instore, even though with the lockdown it was illegal for me to drive the 3 hours to the store. CeX support explained why I was not allowed to post the phone back for an assessment/repair/refund, they told me that because I had bought the phone after the lockdown, this meant I could not post it to them. I bought the phone before the lockdown.

So basically i was searching for a 3ds on cex online and i found an ice white 3ds for only £55 so i bought it.
When it arrived i was happy but i opened box and i took out the 3ds and OH MY GOSH there was no stylus so i was mad but not too mad so i didnt really care but this is where th fun starts i went to go and charge the 3ds there was a orange light which showed and then it went off so me being me i thought that was how the 3ds charges (showing you the light and then charging) i left it for more than 3and a half hours and then i came to take it off the charger then i was trying to turn it on but nothing happened so i was really fustrated because i just spent 55 pounds on a 3ds that has no stylus and that doesnt work
And also
How come when i went to try and sell my dsi (at cex) when i lost my stylus they were like oh sorry we cant take in a dsi without the stylus yet they let another person give in a 3ds without the stylus
Very pathetic cex. 0 out of 0 do not buy from there

Here is a company who will pay a member of its head office staff; Imran; hundreds of pounds to reject warranty claims despite the cost of handling the claim exceeding the cost of the goods.

I bought an iPhone 6s for £170 and it does not charge properly it crashes and does not work properly
It’s scratched and trying to contact them through phone and email with no response is terrible! It’s a lot of money I paid out for a phone like this especially when no one gets back to ne! I’m taking it further as twice this has happened now and the staff are rude and do not seem to know anything they look at you with a dumb expression
Absolutely disgusting

I'd rather have the option for 3.5 stars. The problem with CEX is the inconsistency of quality of service and attitude. Naturally, once you know which ones to use and which ones to avoid, all is great. Sadly you have to be the victim first in order to learn this info and that shouldn't be the case. CEX need to seriously bring the bad stores up to standard of some of the others! Furthermore, don't bother reviewing purchases for them as the often remove them for no obvious reason whatsoever, so don't waste your time to do them a favour. I emailed them one asking exactly what I said that was against their rules and they never ever replied.

This is the worst company to do any sort of business with, after buying an item costing £1000 and staffs don't even know anything about the item they're selling and telling me they looked it up on youtube so the item seems to be working fine, I was gobsmacked is that the so called testing they did to come to the conclusion that the item is fine? Well further action to be taken cos they do not want to replace the item after 20 plus days.

We visited your lakeside branch on Saturday 25/01/2020 we exchanged some dvds for a voucher and with top up purchased a honour 10 mobile phone, after using the phone my partner noticed that the sound keep going while watching YouTube and Spotify, we new it was still in warrenty so brought back the phone on Saturday 15/03/2020 they had to do the usual checks on the phone we returned after 40 minutes to be told the phone was tampered with and the bottom right hand side of the phone had been 'pulled off' we explained that the phone hasn't been touched and because we still had warrenty we come back for you to fix it! Or a refund/exchange the staff members decided we're very rude and didn't want to help in the slightest! After reading alot of reviews on your website I have seen similar responses that it is the customers fault when the product hasnt been touched! I would like a responses and aren't checking the products correctly before being sold on and then blaming the customers for the damage! I would like a response back on the matter other wise it will be taken further action.

Hassle hence 3 stars. To sell my PS4 and change for Xbox One was a bit of hassle. 0- register yourself with Cex 1st you go to Cex leave your console for test 2- you come back to get voucher 3- go home and order Xbox (if they dont have it in shop) 4- receive item not as ordered (Xbox one boxed ordered and Xbox one Got my XBOX one discounted received) 5- complain over phone 6- go back shop return item 7- go back home order again 8- receive correct item .... if i charge for a time i spend on all these activities i would get myself brand new console for that. So it depends how much you value your time.

Please don't sell(give) these guys your old DVDs they'll offer you 1p for them and try to sell them for £1,2,3 or £4 I should have just went to a charity shop or donated the to a children's home.... fell bad now. Also I went to the Holloway branch to sell a tablet I had got for Christmas which I didn't need (but let's keep that between us) and the bloke took one look at me and asked me for I.D he didn't even look at it then started looking for reasons to say no ( I think he thought it was stolen and I would get violent as his hands were shaking while opening the box) he saw that it had a European plug and went to his supervisor who looked up at me and then he came back saying he could take it off my hands because off the European plug!!! A few days later I go to chapel market and I have no probs whatsoever (except feeling robbed of my DVD collection) so I'd honestly say only sell to these guys if you have a phone laptop tablet which is less than 3 years old otherwise your just simply giving it away to a major company who will try to make 75% + profit on them. I'll try spok next time at least it can go directly to someone who needs it. Oh and they don't like to hear any feedback!!!

Buyer beware!!!!!!!!Worst retail experience my wife and I have ever experienced. I bought a second hand I phone 7 from from the Dunfermline store around 6 months ago. It was rated by them as a B grade product due to the scratches on the screen and to the back of the phone which I was happy with as It would be in a case and have a screen protector so they wouldn’t be visible. After some time the screen began to show fault, flickering at the bottom intermittently. I thought this wasn’t a problem as I had a years warranty??????!!!!!!! Nope!!!! I took the phone back to the store in the Kingsgate shopping centre where the staff were so absolutely useless and completely unhelpful. The manager was off that day so I was asked to contact him the next day. After speaking with him he told my wife and I that they couldn’t do anything because there is a crack on the screen. They insisted that I had damaged the phone in some way and this issue was due to a crack on the screen that I had caused. This is not correct. That’s exactly how I brought it from you! Does this meen you shouldn’t have sold it in the first place? Absolutely mental. I am in discussions with the financial ombudsmen currently. You will here from me very soon!

I have previously found CEX in Cheltenham to be great. I have bought second hand games and DVDs for my son, and traded items in once he had grown out of them. However my last two visits to the store have been disappointing. He wanted to get rid if his sky lander figures, so I popped in to ask if they bought them. Yes I was told, some are worth more than others so bring them along and they’ll take a look. I went home, got them, made a special journey back into town. I then spoke to another team member who said they do not take them! When I explained my frustrations at being told something completely different earlier, there wasn’t even an apology. The guy who told me to come back with them was on the adjoining till and could hear my conversation, but not once did he apologise for giving me wrong information. Today I have been in to take my sons PS4 for a repair, which in their website says they do, only to be told on arrival that they do not do repairs. When I asked where they would recommend me take it ‘try Facebook’ was the reply! The member of staff today was polite and quietly spoken, but not particularly helpful. ‘Computer says no’ type of attitude. I strongly recommend CEX delivery more customer service training to their staff, they definitely need it!

I bought a NOW TV box, which itself was fine. The description was not clear fi it included remotes, so I checked and it did. It's all to do with their ABC rating where A is newest, but I assumed C was latest model. Upon arrival, it contained no HDMI cables, so I had to order these separately elsewhere. Try as I might, I could not get these points over on their review page as they kept rejecting it. So, if they only allow positive reviews, how can they be trusted?

Not even worthy of 1 star!!! Don't bother buying second hand through them, you will live to regret it and be out of pocket. Bought a laptop from them a year and a bit ago, have barely used it as was given a work laptop. Now it won't turn on at all. Dell suggested a coin cell battery change, I did that but that wasn't the issue it made no difference. I contacted CEX and because I changed a battery the warranty is void. They won't even look at it to see what went wrong even though this has NOTHING to do with whatever fault there is. £350 down the drain and now have to buy a NEW laptop!!

Offensive and rude standard of service.
I've been using Cex for about 10 years & have witnessed their level of service deteriorate however today will be the final straw.
Having a clear out at home & took a wireless keyboard / mouse set. Right from walking in the door it seemed the 'customer service advisor' (a term used very loosely..) was determined to find fault.
Offensive as it would hardly be worthwhile for me to try & sell a faulty low value item.
Firstly he seemed to insist that there was a problem with the battery cover until the supervisor stepped in & confirmed it was fine.
Then, probably out of small minded spite, he found a small cosmetic crack in the bottom of the keyboard & rejected it on this basis.
Took it to another nearby shop who brought it straight away.
I appreciate you are brand complacent Cex & so you assume that minimum wage customer service advisers are ok to offend customers. I can tell you however this is not acceptable.

I ordered an Apple accessory which was supposed to be delivered on 22 Jan. On 22 Jan courier left a calling card after a failed attempted to deliver per tracking. However per the same tracking, in 3 minutes time, the item had been marked delivered. Seeing this, I went home later and saw that a calling card had been left, but no sign of the package. Tracking chat on the courier website said that it would have been scanned wrongly. Next evening, I went to the courier depot only to be told that the package hadn't been returned to them and that they'd pass it on to senior management for investigation. Assuming that it might have been mistakenly not returned to the depot, and naively believing the chat, booked for a redelivery for the following Saturday through the courier website. Next day however, got a call from courier saying they still couldn't trace it.
Seller sent me a review request on trust pilot. In this, the missing package issue was noted and a customer support executive emailed me. They wanted the copy of the reverse of the calling card which was sent to them on 29 January. Then I was sent this email on 30 Jan. The customer support executive eventually, after a few back and forth emails, wrote back saying ...Based on the conclusion, they have stated that the package has been handed over to you by the courier team.
I am completely flummoxed by this reply from the seller and unsure what to do next. It appears that only sender can claim for insurance in the case of the type of delivery booked.
I had asked for further information on means to recourse but customer support wrote back repeating their last email saying it was delivered without providing clear information on how to escalate the issue.
So having paid nearly £50, I am now left without the item, and a seller who won't acknowledge this, leaving me without any recourse to a refund/reclaim. Lesson learnt: Should have gone to apple store and bought it full price :(

Awful Customer Service
I purchased a case for my new I-pad, this was delivered efficiently, so far so good. I tried my new I-pad in the case and found the plastic was slightly warped so didn't hold the I-pad securely ( held only 3 corners of the I-pad ) I could live with this, but when I tried to extend the back rest I noticed a large crack running the whole width of the case. I decided that I needed to return the as it was clearly faulty...... this is where it became frustrating, when I asked for a refund ( for which I was entitled ) I was told that this couldn't be processed as the fault may have been caused through the delivery company. I showed the supervisor the packaging ( which was not damaged at all ) to which he replied that this couldn't be ruled out still? Slightly baffled by his response I then showed him where the crack was ( it was clearly like it when it was posted out by the shop who had sent it ) as it is where it had been forced by incorrectly extending the rest. I was told that I now needed to contact customer services who would investigate? What would they do? Ask the shop who sent the goods if it was damaged in the first place? I have given up trying to get my money back and shall recommend that no-one I know uses this company again! I am an Manager and would give the customer the benefit of the doubt if was wasn't clear how the problem had occurred. This helps build a relationship with your brand, unfortunately on this occasion his actions now mean that I will no longer use this company.

Unable to exchange the phone for the same model or anything close to the same value. Was offered £420 trade price for it on a gift card for this store. Ridiculous company policy in place. We had the receipts and guarantee. Only reason we waited was as it has been over Christmas and new year. After explaining the situation they said it was nothing they could do. So In the matter of barely a week we lost over £200. I would never use this company again, would also advise everyone to stay clear. They’re policy is a disgrace.

Wasted Journey
I saw an item that indicated it was not available on CEX online but stated that the item was available at the Ellesmere Port store (x2). I checked online prior to travelling to the Ellesmere Port store to be informed that this item had already been sold online! This therefore resulted in a wasted journey and a cost to myself! The online website should be updated more regular to reflect what is available online and in CEX stores.

Let me tell you what has happened so far with this literal corrupt company.
I sent off my items all well and good, the second they received them they updated me (that's fine) but then have me wait over a week and not even tell me why they are not updating me is ridiculous.
The funny thing is, they waited for me to write them an email and then rushed to reply back telling me my items are not sellable due to no serial number on a controller and Xbox one.
If this wasn't bad enough, they already accepted one controller without a serial number.
To top it off, the number provided to call doesn't let you speak to anybody, it just asks you for your order number, then the second you try to say it or type it, the phone says the other person has cleared I tried the phone about 4 times and the same thing happens over and over again.
They are leaving me unsure of what they are doing with my items, wether they are just discarding them or sending them back to me leaving me cautious.
My honest opinion, don't sell to these guys, they truly are a worthless company in the sense they don't care for their customers.
If my items are not given back to me in the same condition as I sent them in, or if they don't give them back, there will be further action taken and this won't be the last of it.
The internet will see what CeX is all about and they will no longer have a company. They have truly chosen to one to many people to do this to. Have a good day :)

Sadly CEX is currently in breach of their terms of warrentee and I am struggling to get an official complaint to be correctly processed. I feel that they have very limited understanding of good customer service and it all smacks of someone answering emails from.their bedroom with no real understanding of grammar, fact or purchasing laws 🤦🏼‍♀️buyer beware - if you want cheap dont expect any sort of customer service and dont expect them to care when you have a problem with your goods as they really dont.

Give them a clean for God's sake, you may sell them quicker. And some of the staff there are so miserable looking and blunt with there answers.

One of the worst company to deal with I sent back a 40mm 2.8 lens as it was very slow to focus and had no caps after they got it back I had an email saying they will not refund me as no caps but I did not get any to start with so nowi`am trying to get a refund this happens a lot it’s a big lottery when you order on line some times the items are good but in must case they are damaged or have bits missings they you have to try to get you’re money back that’s a real fight

We sold a phone to CEX which was in full working order, complete in box and pretty much as new. 6 months later (last month) a letter comes through from Business Loss Prevention (BPL) saying the phone we had sold to CEX had been blocked and they wanted the money back or would be going down the civil suit route. A quick email to BPL to point out that we aren't giving them a single penny unless they come back with 100% proof this was to do with US and not the person who bought the phone from them after we had sold it, and they seem to have suddenly gone away. Given that CEX check devices before buying them to make sure they aren't lost or stolen or blocked ect, this seems like some kind of scam they've got going on to try and extort money from folk.
Never sell high value devices to these people.

Device took 3 weeks instead of the 7 days promised, after the repair center received the device there would have to be an increase in charge. So i declined the work (£95-> £198). The device was returned in 3 Working days however on collection there was a scratch across the screen. If i return the device they can do an internal Investigation what will take a further week.

I went into branch last year with an e-reader. I turned it on in FRONT of them and it was in working conition. An hour later, it was broken and the screen looked like it had either been smashed or a magnet run across it. This week, I sent an LG phone to them in perfect condition and they are returning it saying its damaged. What rip of merchants, liars, thieves and shysters.

Bought a iPhone 6 months ago, it started to not work so returned just on the 6 months to the day! They confirmed faulty, gave me another phone last week, had phone 1 day and noticed not holding charge, was away at the till today, returned, but told my phone had been water damaged ! This phone has not been near any water steam or anything, it must have been damaged when given to me last week! Although they say they have replaced the battery today! I am disgusted and wish I got a refund for my previous phone now, as I now have no warranty on my phone!
Disgusting service, my 85 year old mother whose phone it is being accused of damaging it! Just a joke!

I told them to send them back which I don't think they are my phones there's damage to them both. The phone charger is damaged when it wasn't when I sent it and they have not sent me my Sony charger back just a broken charger never again am I using them.

I have long been a customer at the Sunderland branch (recently changed location but essentially the same business) buying predominately dvds' I've tended to return due to the good, affordable prices, the good selection and generally good quality of the products. However I feel the service and organisation can greatly improve. Despite the store now being smaller, there are usually 5 or 6 staff behind the till yet service is usually quite slow- i've literally seen staff talking and joking among themselves whilst customers are waiting to be served. I appreciate they can't do everything at once but they should at least acknowledge people are waiting instead of giving the impression they don't care. In addition on several occasions now I have went to buy a dvd i'd long been looking for only to find it can't be found! So why put the box on display? This just seems like sloppy organising. The staff are not rude per sa but I do think they need to improve customer service and organisation.

They are awful to decent people and decent to awful people. They deserve to work in that place, it smells like urine and armpits.

Company is an utter disgrace, I sent a Bluetooth speaker in which was in perfectly good condition and like new only to have it returned by them saying that there was damage. I packed the speaker in plenty of wrapping so there wouldn’t be any damage. Speaker was returned with the front grill which was stuck down firmly when sent pulled away from the bottom of the unit. I don’t know what staff they employ here but I will be taking this matter up further as this is not the first time I’ve had problems with this company. Advice I’d give to the company is, if you damage an item someone tries to sell to you in good faith, then you should be held responsible for the damage and at least have the good faith to pay.

Took a phone in Eastleigh store to sell - visually inspected by staff and they were happy with condition. Went back to collect next day after testing and a small crack had magically appeared. Had to get screen replaced before they would accept it. Then given a lower price than originally quoted as they had misquoted the wrong model initially! Tells you all you need to know! If you have to use them, would advise getting them to write and sign on the exchange receipt their happiness with the condition and quotation proce.

Absolutely awful! Do not use the Aylesbury shop.
I leave a 2 month old mobile phone that I stopped using after about a week for testing. They inform we when I return that the phone does not accept charging. This is ridiculous as I charged the phone ahead of taking it in without any issue, it’s at 100%. To satisfy myself I checked when I got home and it is perfectly ok.
In the shop I ask for the plastic sleeve to be returned and after about 5 minutes of looking they tell me they cannot find it. When asked to look in the bin they find it! Honestly words fail me!

That's not going to happen; you can keep the phone if you like the 'person' who claimed I was in 'HIS' shop, kept telling me to leave, that I was barred, that I would behave and speak as he dictated; Do NOT buy from these disreputable scoundrels, thieves and liars, liars and thieves

I recently i visited CEX in Milton Keynes, I asked them to value my Samsung S8 against an unlocked Samung s10+G5 in A condition which they were selling for £790.00. They advised they needed to test my phone and this would take 30 minutes. They took my phone and raised no concern about its condition, however on my return they advised my phone had a crack which I was very surprised about as I make a habit of looking after my phones. Anyway as I could proved they had damage it, I agreed to go ahead and purchase the S10 + 5G. I took the phone to EE and purchased a new sim, but for some reason they struggled to get the phone to recognise the sim and advised me to take the phone to a Samsung store as there appeared to be something wrong. Samsung checked the phone out on their system and apparently It was not showing where it was made and had other details that Samsung were concerned about. I went back to CEX and explained to them what Samsung had discovered and asked for a refund however despite this they refused to refund my money which I had paid them a few hours earlier. I again went back to Samsung to obtain further details of their concerns and we discovered that the phone had been imported from outside the EU and tethered to a Korean network which meant the 5G wouldn't work in this country anyway. After almost 7 hours, reluctantly CEX refunded my money but did not make any offer to compensate me for my time. So please be cautious if you purchase anything from CEX and what's more they will try and avoid respecting consumer rights. This experience was dreadful and has certainly made it more likely I will avoid using them in the future

Simply do not bother getting a quote to sell them games via the app or website. It's a con. I repeat IT'S A CON. One more time, it's a con, do not do it.
Very simple, they quote you reasonable prices for the games, then when you send them they 'find' reasons not to accept them. Then if you were lucky enough to tick the box that says if your items are not accepted do you want them returned you should get them back. Otherwise they resell the item and you get nothing. Revolting con, I will repeat it again, do not use them or trust these con merchant cowboys.

Took perfect condition phone into Lincoln branch only to be told it was scratched. When I questioned this and asked for second opinion told I couldn't have one as he was the manager. Pointed out he was looking at marks that I rubbed off with my finger. Then said there was a different scratch. When I said there was no scratch manager said he didn't like the way I was speaking to him. I showed the phone to a random member of public who said they could see no marks on phone. Manager said he didn't like my attitude, wiped phone with his t-shirt and announced it now had a scuff mark! Again I said there were no marks so manager handed me the phone and said I had to leave the shop. As I walked out he shouted out in front of the whole store I was barred as he didn't like how I spoke to him. I sent complaint to head office who asked for photos of phone. After 3 days I just keep being told this is being investigated. Absolute disgrace really. For catching the manager trying to rip me off and questioning him I've now been banned.

Same as many others. Purchased 2 items both in stock (about 4 of each). Stock picking went on for a few days and both orders eventually cancelled. Could not find item in stock! This has happened to me before. It is not difficult for a system to stop an in shop sale once an item has been purchased on line. We are in the age of the PC. On line sale is a bit hit and miss. I have received some outstanding items and others that appear to be dragged from bin. The grading system is poor.

Good when it's good, terrible when it's bad - be extremely wary of purchasing anything online from CEX/WeBuy.
My company has purchased several Mac accessories from CEX over the past couple of years, mostly mice and keyboards. Though the service wasn't the quickest and the products weren't always the cleanest (had to scrub a few keyboards), by and large it was a good transaction.
Recently however, I ordered another batch of a few mice and a couple of keyboards, we have them spare in the office for when new people join or old ones break down. Unfortunately, when we tested them (not immediately) the two keyboards were faulty, one had a key that fell off on first press and the other had several keys that didn't respond to pressing at all. Btw, the keyboards were category A and B, so meant to be in pretty good shape.
I emailed CEX and they told me that we could take them into a local store, they would be tested and we would be refunded if there was an issue - here's the important bit, there was no mention of a timescale (the terms on their site mention a 24 month warranty). Returning keyboards being fairly low priority for a business, we didn't end up taking the keyboards in for several weeks.
Taking the keyboards into the store (again, no meniton that the delay was a problem) they said the keyboards would have to be tested. We didn't hear anything for a while so we got in touch to ask what was going on - it turns out that the keyboards were broken, there were signs of wear and tear, so they wouldn't be able to refund us.
I was obviously quite surprised by this because we knew they were faulty - that was why we had taken them back. The insinuation was clear, we had somehow broken the keyboards since we received them. When I suggested this was a little ridiculous (over email) the only response I have been given is that we should have taken them in sooner.
There is no mention of how much sooner. There is, as far as I can see, nothing in their t&cs about an exact timeframe either. They say there's nothing they can do.
The takeaway - if you want to buy something from CEX, make sure you go to the shop and test the product then and there. As far as I can tell the 24 month warranty is completely useless because they can always argue that you took to long to lodge a complaint or that the fault is your own fault. It's not impossible to get a good bargain from them but it comes with a lot of risk.

I purchased an Xbox One from the Nottingham Victoria Centre shop. The Xbox was reasonably priced, so I went ahead with the purchase. The staff were unfriendly and unprofessional. They didn't speak to me at all during my purchase, and didn't answer my questions. I unboxed it at home, and found out that the controller was a cheap replica of a wired Xbox controller. Additionally, I only receive half of the power supply, and I received a cable which didn't connect to my Xbox, nor did it connect to my TV. I returned it the next day, only to be spoken down to. I received the correct cables, but I hadn't received the cable for the controller. I went back the day after, only to be patronized again. I ended up spending an unnecessary amount on bus fares, and wasted two days trying to sort these issues out. I emailed Cex to inform them of the issues which I encountered and to request some sort of compensation for the bus fares and the inconvenience. However, the reply I received was blunt, and spoke down to me again. I didn't receive a refund, because the situation wasn't their fault. I've encountered other issues but this is the main one. DO NOT BUY FROM CEX.

My daughter brought a mobile phone with a so called 2 year warranty. It became faulty and the staff found the fault and we were offered a replacement. Eight months later the replacement phone developed a fault so I asked for a full refund. The staff asked for proof of the fault so we downloaded an app and recorded the phone glitching. A week later we returned the phone again only to be told by the staff member that we would not get a full refund. Despite CEX boasting about their 2 year warranty, she was only offered the current market value which was £120 less than she had paid 8 months before. This was despite having the original receipt. I have checked with other Companies who sell second hand devices and they have all stated that they would have given a full refund. DO NOT SHOP HERE.

they initially quote a good price for your device and when you send it over, they would significantly deduct the price using false reasons like there is a scratch on the camera glass, this device is non-UK version, it's not powering on and etc. I tried them three times and it happened every single time. None of these reasons were true(truly I know my devices were all bought in Apple stores in the UK and they were fully functional). I got these devices recycled by other companies at full quoted prices. Stay away, save your time.

Awful company. They sell themselves as a trendy company staffed by geeks and slackers but in reality they are rude and must follow strict guidelines to rip the customer off.
They will find any excuse to downgrade an item from an A to a B grade in order to maximise profit. Usually a staff member will go into the testing area with your phone and tablet, put it under an electron microscope and find a virtually invisible mark and then use that to justify giving you less money for it.
Staff are generally rude and you can tell they are usually hungover, annoyed because their pay packet was wrong or they just are people poorly suited to customer service. Overall, I would highly recommend selling your stuff on gumtree, Shpock or ebay instead.

When I checked, the lens they had sent me was a budget Canon Kit lens that comes free with a basic camera, not the L level professional lens which I ordered.
Tried to contact them but they don't have a phone number to speak to someone so emailed, took a day to get back to me with a standard response advising I can get a replacement even though that their website is showing none in stock.
Sigh.

Where do I even start. I went to cex Leeds crossgates to trade in my Nikon DSLR 7000 with 2 lenses and a battery grip, all in pristine condition GradeA one employee said, but the other 2 that was behind the counter said no its Grade B as it has 1 mark, (fingerprint smudge on screen that they even wiped off) I could even add photos to prove condition. I'm a photographer/videographer hobbyist and take real good care of my equipment. I even told them I wanted to trade as i wanted to purchase a Panasonic 4k camcorder they had online. I left without a sale and sold my Nikon online elsewhere. I contacted Cex online (customer services) explaned my case shown proof of my equipment and how I felt like they was trying to RIP me off and was issued a £10 evoucher as a sorry, I accepted that and was great full. I ordered the Panasonic 4k camcorder online as a Grade B, expecting it to be as my Nikon Grade B give or take the box you no. It arrived today it a terrible state, viewfinder was damaged, the wind proof microphone mesh was packed with mud like it had been dropped in mud, the rest of the body and charger looked like it had been sat on a dusty shelf for years. I took it to my local branch Leeds crossgates and asked the head man in there what condition he would sell it as to witch he replied 100% Grade C an asked what I payed for it as he was checking on his computer, I told him £335.00, and he then said its sorted I've issued you a full refund into your payment method, I never instructed or asked for a refund I simply asked him what Grade he would class it as, and how we could resolve it. I even asked him if he could of refunded the diference from Grade B to Grade C, his reply after changing something on the computerhe was on was we only Grade camcorders as Grade A or Grade B, clearly lieing about that as there are Grade C Camcorders on there site. I Shocked as to why he would even lie about it. He mentioned the DSLR I had wanted to sell and I told him I had contacted customer support and they said from pictures I sent they would have had no issues as to list my Nikon as a Grade A, to witch he replyed, I don't care what some customer service employee said sat over in India behind a desk without a clue what hes doing. I asked why the remark about India, and his reply was that's where the idiots are. I was shocked even a couple of other customers laughed in shock. I felt uncomfortable been spoke to like that about a product I had purchased, this whole experience as left me wanting to take it further. I'm now unable to purchase a camera to film this weekend motorsport as my money's on hold with PayPal. I would give this no stars if I could. I'm not leaving all this as I'm now out of action for the next couple of weekends due to him. I'm really not dropping this.

I bought a Samsung tablet in Feb 2019 from a cex store in bishop Auckland a and it suddenly started to get lines on screen whilst I was using it.i took it back today 7.5.2019 and told them that it started to get lines on screen whilst I was using it.was asked to leave tablet for a warranty check.went back to be told it was pressure damage I asked what they meant and was told it must have either been sat on or someone's put pressure on it.after I'd told them there's only me that uses it and I certainly haunt done either I was told there was nothing they could do.i am absolutely disgusted and so upset.ive bought a few phones from cex in fact the one I'm using is from there.this is the 1st time I've returned anything I paid 135 pound to have to be going home with a useless tablet that I've owned for 3 months.its a disgrace how cex can treat me like this I'm 55 years old and felt like they don't believe the truth.i can't afford another tablet it was a gift from my husband.

First order - I bought a Sony XPERIA XZ2 through their online store and given it was Grade A I was expecting it in its box with all original accessories.
The phone came wrapped in bubble wrap with some CeX branded accessories.
I had to open a ticket to request all the original accessories it had to come with. I got some of them but not pleased as experience was not smooth and I still lacked the box, SIM card tool etc.
Second order - Online order of a Panasonic Lumix camera lens. The lens came wrapped in bubble wrap again without its box or original accessories (lens hood or lens bag). After opening a ticket I was told they do not consider a lens hood as essential.
All in all, do NOT order online from CeX. Only in store to make sure you know what you're getting.
Only internal phones and emails so you cannot get in touch with a specific store and customer service doesn't seem to be bothered to connect you with these stores or do it for you.

Went in store to sell my honor view 20, left it with them while they tested it, came back find it now had a scratch across the screen and on top of that they had put a password on it, good job I stayed at the checkout and checked my phone first or I wouldn't of been able to use it. Think they only ended up buying for the full amount they first quoted me before I left it because I made a fuss and refused to move until they had removed the password and could prove the phone had no scratches on it when I left it as I had taken a pic which had the time and date on it. Would never take anything there again, talk about try to rip you off

Terrible shop in East Kilbride..

Was sold a samsung plug and cable. Tried it but same problem with these. it only charges phone slow. Tried to return today to be told that I could only return for credit as it was more than two days. Under the low, as I was sold something unfit for purpose, I am entitles to a full refund up to 30 days. They dont even have a refund posted on their wall. Needless to say, I will never return to this shop again. I lost £11, but you have lost a customer.

Terrible company bought an ipod and the battery failed so quick. So took it back and was told I was sold an ipod with faulty battery, sent it back and was told they would refund me or swap it. Got an email saying I could have neither and worst of all said I could not have my ipod back either, they basically stole it, but you cant arrest a corporation.
They said I am only getting £50 voucher or nothing, so basically they win either way!!! Sucj a bad company, so £50 voucher when bought ipod for£120 few months earlier, you can make your own mind up with this.

CeX is terrible, it's just a joke you cannot phone ANY branch at all the online customer service is terrible and the people in store are polite and nice people but have no way of contacting any other store, so you cannot find out what type of condition a product is which is ridiculous when they only give 3 grading groups, that is nowhere near enough to accurately tell what condition your phone will come in, I received a phone with a massive scratch on the front as a b grade phone the cable it came with was in terrible condition too, definitely a c in my eyes, they also won't let you take the phone back then buy it again. For example if you want to buy a phone to test it out (because the grading is garbage) they will not let you take it back, trade your old phone in and then repurchase it so you have to gamble and give up your old phone before you even see their phone online it's cannot call itself a business

AWFUL!!!!!
RUN AND DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
Purchased a phone which had an issue with the battery, took it back and was advised to use the phone and only if it was really bad should I take it back and they would run a diagnostic (Letchworth Store). When I did take the phone in I explained to the manager/supervisor (the most senior person in the Luton Store at the time) that I had been unable to back the phone up and that it should not be wiped. The manager assured me that this would not happen but to my dismay when I returned to the store they had completely wiped 8000 videos and pictures had been deleted.
I received a full refund for the phone which this disguised as a 'goodwill payment'. I will never use a CEX store again and I will ensure that none of my family or friends EVER USE this useless chain again!!!!!!!!!!!!

So I went pick up my surface pro 5 from Bromley branch. There are numerous scratches! (some scratch are 10cm long and deep) near the volume rocker is chipped, the touch screen isn't even working properly, there's dead zone on the screen where the touch doesn't work. The camera is partially covered by wire, speaker mesh is frayed/damaged, there's glue on the edge of the screen and there's some unknown dirt on the fold which looks like weed. They didn't just not fix my screen but managed to damage it even more, I am really disappointed and angry with the service!!

I now use CEX online a fair amount, probably 5-8 DVDs or Blu-rays a month, and I've found their service to be very good. Purchases are typically delivered within two working days [occassionaly 1 working day, occassionally three working days]. Where I feel CEX could improve is that their listings do not contain enough information & some are really pretty slovenly. This can result in thinking you are buying one edition only to have another one delivered instead. I recently ordered a particular BD based on the picture and [scanty] item info. The item that turned up was the same film but a different edition to the one pictured in the listing. Although it is easy to return items to CEX & get a refund, if they took a little more time in describing items more acurately it would save their customer dissappointment and the trouble of queueing up to resolve the matter. That said, the prices I sometimes pay for specialist films are substantially below what I would pay other well-known sites. The other related problem is that when I returned the item in question to my local branch it reappeared on the CEX site as again available from the store, but still with the same misleading picture and description. Someone else is going to buy it and will most likely return it as I did. Overall the service I get from CEX online is excellent.

My daughter purchased a phone from the kings Lynn store back in November,unfortunately a week ago the battery developed problems as the phone will only now work with the charger plugged in.I took the phone to the kings Lynn store and upon examination a very small crack was found in the top corner of the screen and I was then told it was accidental damage and nothing could be done.I find this despicable as the phone is in very good condition and the small crack does not have any effect on the operation.It is the battery that is faulty which needs to be plugged in to the charger then it will function perfectly.My daughter saved very hard to but this phone which was £95 and she is now very upset as she has only has the phone since November.I also feel very upset that this attitude has been adopted and as a very good customer I will be seeking an alternative to your stores in the future. yours D Fountain

I'll never shop there again and I'm stuck with a £58 voucher because I won't by another thing from them again , they change prices for who enters the store , a con shop stay clear is my advice .

first time using cex and will be the last time, tried buying a xbox one controller a few days ago for £42 and it was clearly second hand, didn't even last one day as the left stick wouldn't work, we tried getting a refund of which we couldn't so they offered a exchange .. it took nearly 2 hours to do because they had to carry out checks on the controller of which they said everything was ok which it clearly wasn't … so we were given another controller in exchange and that too has problems , the sticks are stiff, rusted and have a delay on them.
it is absolutely scandalous how they can charge £42 for second hand controllers they should be valued at £15-25 its just a scam that we cant get a refund for.

I was after a decent headset so I went to cex store Sunderland and found a pair of beats. I bought them on the understanding they were wireless as was told they were and this was the charger. Happy I got them took them home to find out they weren't wireless but I liked them so kept them. Now at the weekend I was in cex at hartlepool as my daughter wanted a game. I seen a pair of bose headset. So my partner asked are they wireless and the staff as it took 2 to tell him they will be. So again took them home to find out they are exactually the same as the beats. Does noone train these people. I could have took them back for a credit note which is wrong as my partner asked if they were wireless. Why should i have a credit note for something they cant get right. And as i found out i could of had the same pair off amazon new for £15 cheaper. Not just are they useless but also rip people off with prices.

I ordered an iphone, I paid £115, I waited two weeks (when a special one day delivery was “promised”). Nothing came.
I found out my order was delivered to someone else! I found out this MYSELF. Nothing was sent to notify me. No one from CEX was interested in the case. I had to investigate everything myslef. So much HASSLE! Every time I was approaching cex, Puneet from customer sevices was sending to me automatic responses that “we are sorry your product was delivered to a wrong person. Allow us 48 hours”. And this continued a week and a half. Then, I had to change my attitude in order to make them act. Two weeks and a half after I paid, after their “one day”special delivery and after my 10 emails, they refunded me. Based on my nightmare personal experience, I Do NOT RECOMMEND using cex at all!

Was ripped off by CEX.
Went in on first day and spent about an hour going through various items to sell them. Play station, dvds, ps3 games, Nintendo wii and games.. you get the gist. At the end I was told in total £73 for all, which was a bit disappointing, none the less decided to sell as was no use and didn’t want hassle of selling myself. At that point the staff member asked if I wanted to sell them the ps3 ( as they were only offering £19 for it less £15 as they said they would need to replace one of the remotes as it had a small crack in it) so basically £4 for a perfectly working ps3 console with working but small cracked remote! Anyway I said yes again so total was £77. They then said I would receive my money in a couple of days once they checked it was all working. Well after 4 days nothing so my parter went in to chase them up, at this point they put £55 onto her card, with my partner not knowing the amount they put on the card she left the shop. ( have to mention my partener didn’t know any of the discussions or monetary values for the items and she was just going in to ask when the balance would be paid). When I later spoke with her we then learnt that the amounts were different. When I emailed the complaints department to explain I was basically told that the £55 was the correct figure and that was final. Completely robbed and lied to. I know it’s only a difference of £22 but for what they got from me and the fact it was agreed the figure of £77, I was told shop was correct and I would not be getting my money and would no longer take my complaint.
Do not use this company as they just rob you. I certainly would never use them again and I will be making sure to be sharing my experience.

8 months ago I bought an AMD RX580 from CeX. It seemed faulty almost straight away, the mouse was stuttering across the screen. I tried everything I could think of to troubleshoot but it still didn't work properly.
I brought it into a store and described the issues. They tested it and claimed that no fault was found.
Miraculously it worked for a while after that, but then I started having issues again. I troubleshooted again, reinstalled Windows and bought a new CPU from them.
I brought it into the store again, and was told no fault found, again.
This winter I gave up and decided to trade it in, for half what I paid (for a card that never fully worked, no less).
Just now, I looked at the test receipt from trading in the graphics card. Nothing is ticked on the checklist, but handwritten is the following: No fault found
Comments
Over heating while idle
Stuttering mouse movement.
So in other words, when they test a graphics card for a refund, they don't find the fault described. But when I want to trade it in for half the money, they claim no fault found yet acknowledge some of the issues I described, twice, to staff in the same store.

I call shenanigans cos of the amount of games I’ve bought from the same store “complete in box” only to find out they have fake inlays
So in summary selling a complete in box item is apparently a term you only use to rip people off

DO NOT SELL TO CEX. I recently took my 2012 MacBook Pro in to sell, which was in great condition with no scratches or dents, as well as functioning very well too. I took it to CEX and they gave me a quote of £250, assuring me that the laptop looked in good condition and so there should be no problem. I had wiped and reset the laptop, and so the worker was setting it up right in front of me, and it clearly was functioning well. They told me I would hear back from them within 2 working days max. After 6 days of absolutely no contact, I receive a call saying that I have to go and pick up the laptop as it won't turn on. I was shocked by this as I knew for a fact the laptop worked fine. Upon arriving in the shop, I saw within seconds that the laptop had not even been charged! This was strange as I had handed it in fully charged. After leaving the laptop to charge for an hour, they said there was nothing they could do as they have been trying to switch it on for days but nothing happened. What was particularly ridiculous was that they were in fact able to set up the laptop enough put a brand new password on it... I am greatly convinced that they took my laptop for parts and then claimed it was already broken when I gave it in, a clear lie. I wouldn't want this to happen to anyone else as now I can't even try to sell the laptop elsewhere as it is broken. Definitely use a more reliable shop or site!

Non existent customer service!!!! No way to get in touch with a 'human' to discuss any issues. No email just messenger and I think Twitter. You can wait a day or more for a reply to your message. If you have no problems I guess it is OK but if you need help you won't get it very quickly if at all. When I decided to ask to speak to a manager in our local store, we were informed he was on his lunch break and wasn't coming out!!!!

Rude manager at Birmingham city centre store. Does not know how to conduct himself. Went to the store on Saturday 12th jannat around 4pm to return an iPhone I ordered online. Unfortunately it was not the condition I expected. He basically accused me of causing the scratch. Told me that I had to email head office and they would verify with the pictures they would have. I hadn’t even switched the phone on and returned it the same day it arrived. He basically insulted me and treated me like I was a liar. Disgraceful

Agreed a price then paid less
Do not even want to give one star. After inspection of my phones, a price was agreed and forms were filled in. We were told the money would be in our account within a day or two. We have now just received a voicemail saying that they are going to pay us a lot less now because of one of wear and tear on one of the phones. Scandalous!

Avoid! Sold a faulty ipad, returned it within the week with a receipt. The fault was seen by a member of CEX at the till. The staff member advised me to leave the ipad and the tester will test further. I hear nothing back and chase it up via e-mail as you can not contact them via telephone. I am then told the ipad is fine and to come and collect? The staff at Leeds town centre are rude and do not want to help..... this is still on going. Avoid at all costs!!!!!!!

Purchased an i pad on behalf of my Mum as a Christmas present for my Dad it cost £95. I discovered that it wouldn't charge. I took it back and was given another. On Xmas day we discovered the i pad was locked with a code we didn't have. My Dad and nephew went back to the shop after Christmas and were told to come back an hour and half later. When they returned they were given yet another i pad. Back at home myself ,my nephew and Dad sat at the table to set up the i pad only to discover it hadn't been unlocked. Totally fed up by this point i took it to another branch the next day and though more pleasant was told i needed to email my complaint (There is no phoning with Cex) I emailed my complaint then decided to go back to the branch I bought it from and appeal to them for help or to give me a refund, which I was bluntly refused .I was all but accused of causing the problem myself and they would not take any action until I had heard from my email. I could not believe this was happening and felt so distressed and upset. When Cex eventually emailed me back, they said that on the stores CCTV it showed the i pad had no code on it ?? Basically accusing us of putting a code in and then lying about it ??. This was so unfair and very, very untrue. My Dad tried again by going into the store the next day but was met with the same stoic, behaviour. He insisted an email was sent to head office,and believing this had been done he left, I received no email other than a customer satisfaction email (hilarious) . We ended up going to Apple to get the i pad unlocked, what a difference, professional ,friendly and understanding and very shocked at what had happened to us.
Cex (guess i should have known by the name) I will be putting on all my social media how disgusted I am at what you put us through. Our Christmas was marred and we had unnecessary stress, and time that as a family we simply did not need or deserve

Cex is a bad company wouldn’t recommend anyone to shop there or even trade stuff in as they rip you off as they’re policy is if you have the game got to return it within two days even if it’s a xmas present which I don’t think is fair as my partner had gotten me a game she didn’t know I had and I didn’t know till xmas day when I went back instead of getting the full refund of £15 she got £8 back and as I picked up a game that was same value and she had to pay £7 towards it I am not going back to them as they are money stealing bastards

Every DVD bought from Cex, (I have bought a lot from Cex in the past), every single one has been damaged and would skip at random points during viewing, whenever you take the disc into Cex they offer to clean it but then say their machines aren't as good as they use to be, the same problem keeps happening, better off paying a bit more and having games and DVDs working rather than being left disappointed.

Bought Forza Motorsport 4 for £5 as it was the 2 disc version and it was labeled as 2 disc. I've just opened the case only to find the essentials edition, therefore I got half the game at full price. I'm going admit that it has been 5 days since I bought this and I should have checked then, but they shouldn't have given me the wrong game to begin with.

Bought a 2nd hand video card with 3 fans from Cex with a 2 year warranty. Discovered one of the fans had sheared off. Checked and found that it was still within the warranty. Brought the video card in for a warranty check. Was told, initially that it was determined that the damage was caused by the customer because the video card's case had been opened(I hadn't). Pointed out that if it had been opened I bought it off them in that state, seeing as it was a pre-owned product.
Later on told that the damage was caused by customer because i had overpowered the card. Same thing, I hadn't because I don't overclock. Inconsistancy between reasons given shows they're lies invented to allow them to refuse to honour the warranty.
Cex are crooks, will never buy from them again.

Order number EQ230081
18th Nov made a visit to Cex East Ham, was served by Hammad, I had 6 brand new unlocked mobile phone which I wanted to sell price was agreed and a form was filled out. I thought instead of cash I would get the payment as bank transfer so I wouldn’t have to come back to the shop. Hammad had advised me that by the 20th Nov latest I would have the money in my account, I waited until the 21st and got nothing so on the 21st I went to Cex East Ham and had spoken to a young Asian girl who told me the phones have not been checked and she doesn’t know why but it will be check today and yet another form was filled out and that I would get the bank transfer in my account by 22nd nov but of course still nothing no payment so I went back to Cex East Ham a third time on 22 nov and had spoken to Hammad again and he was unsure why this wasn’t proceed but whilst I was in store at the counter he had proceed it all and I will get the money in my account by 23rd nov and he was 110% sure about that, those were his words. So today is 23rd Nov and still no money has been paid into my bank account? Wonder if anyone can help as in store they don’t seem very professional and obviously don’t care about their customers and don’t know how to provide customer service and are good at lying this proves. I have patiently waiting but after the third time this is getting ridiculous and really annoying me and wasting my time.

Took a faulty item to Bletchley branch,they tested item and stated nothing wrong,tested item again at home,definitely faulty,took it back again to be told the same thing even with someone else noting the problem.
The alleged manager was a total waste of space(put politely). He obviously has no clue how to handle customers correctly.couldn't check water temperature correctly,left and took item to MK centre branch,Funny thing,
They checked the item on the same day.Found the fault straight away,solved my issue,fixed the problem quickly easily and proffesionaly,Bletchley branch useless.

SCAMMERS! SCAMMERS! SCAMMERS! Do not buy anything from them, especially phones. They would find thousands excuses not to accept the item back under the warranty. I bought iPhone from them in August and it stopped working after 3 months. I could not switch it on, it went completely black. I went to the Hounslow branch in London and wanted them to repair it, or give me replacement/refund but they refuse it. First thing they said to me is that I could have brought a different item as they cannot prove it it's theirs. The phone was not switching on so they were unable to check IMEI number. It was my word against theirs. I lost £400 and they did not do anything to help me. If they are selling the phones they supposed to have a way to prove it it's theirs. Why should I prove it? I brought the phone in the original box and receipt from them. What kind of business it is? They are making money cheating on people. They will give you 24 months warranty but would do anything just not to accept the faulty item back. Liars. Also, when I said I paid £400 the blondie said to me I didn't pay her so I said I paid the business you are working for and you must be getting a salary, she just laugh at my face. When I said I want to talk to a manger they told me he's not there and would not provide me with a number. They told me to email headquarters. Horrible, horrible customer service. I ended up with a faulty item and £400 out of my pocket. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. CONS

I took my console to the west bromwich store to be told to wait 45 mins to then be told they wouldnt take it because they couldnt take off the profile and reset it. I got home and reset it in less than 2 mins after catching a taxi there and having to walk home because of their incompetence, the staff clearly dont know what they are doing and it cost me money.

Avoid buying stuff online from them! My boyfriend ordered some light bulbs online from them b22 twice and every single time we receive the wrong ones. We have also mentioned in the first email we sent, to double check the package they send you the 2nd time. Also they don't ever respond to your emails, ignoring you completely until you go into the store to get a refund. My boyfriend had returned all the light bulbs to them and we won't ever consider buying anything from them ever again.

I have purchased a few items from CEX online. While the items do arrive in a timely manner on multiple occasions now I have received the wrong item, each time a far cheaper item has been sent. Upon returning one of the wrong items to the local store I was met with a bad attitude and told I would be required to wait 40 minutes while the item was tested. I found that highly amusing seen as it wasn’t even the correct item, I don’t see why there was any relevance in checking the item, working or not it wasn’t what I ordered. The attitude of the sales staff in the shop was less than welcoming (downright rude); I will never set foot in the Kilmarnock branch again as a consequence. After my first experience I was gifted a £10 voucher for my troubles. But alas yet again more incorrect items were sent. There appears to be no interest whatsoever in answering any queries in a timely manner. It’s a complete and utter joke that items cannot be checked prior to being shipped yet need to be thoroughly checked before they are refunded. I still await any form of response to this. Pay good money in good faith only to be sent incorrect items. If you enjoy the lottery then purchase an item from CEX online and you never know you may hit the jackpot and actually receive the correct item. If 0 stars was an option then this mob would be getting zero stars. The time and effort required for me to return the garbage they sent is not worth it so I effectively wasted my money.

In the space of 4 days, I have had to re-visit CEX in Reading - on friar street, 4 times!
Firstly I went to trade in an in-expensive camera valued at roughly £40. The member of staff called 'Sean E' (taken from my receipt) actually snapped a piece of the casing when he was doing the checks and then had the audacity to tell me they wouldn't take it because it was broken, and denied breaking it after doing so infant of me! 'Sorry dude we're not taking that' I was absolutely fuming. After telling him to get his manager and explain the situation, he came back and told me they would rightfully be giving me the money - instead of apologising, he said nothing and I was on my way.
I also wanted to trade in my iPhone 6 which had a cracked screen and scuffing on the back, I was told to pay to get the screen replaced elsewhere and bring it back by one person, who said the scuffs weren't an issue as they were cosmetic. Then upon returning, they forgot to test it over the weekend - so I had to make 2 trips in one day back to the shop. When I got back (again) they then said they wouldn't take it because of the cosmetic scuffs??? Eventually after complaining for a while and to 3 or 4 different members of staff that were sent over to me, I got some money for it.
The work done by these staff is absolute guess work, there are no guidelines at all in CEX. I was also given 3 different valuation prices for the phone by 3 different members of staff, one for every time I visited....
It'll be music to their ears that I'm not coming back after the amount of complaining i've done, there definitely needs to be more training done at this shop, staff were so un-professional... 'dude'.

Sent off my wife's Samsung galaxy s5 to them as they graded it as good condition on website and £70 to sell to them. Eventually got reply to say it was regraded to not working as back cover was damaged. The back cover was in good condition as it was always kept in a case with no cracks or bits broken off which was the case when it was returned to me as their new offer of £10 was not acceptable. Looks like they will damage your phone to lower the price as previously noted in other reviews (wish I had noticed this first). So I now have to buy new back cover before sending it off to a reputable company. So avoid like the plague. You have been warned.

It is not worth the risk of purchasing from this company. I received a damaged camera lens worth over 500. The company requested I return the item for investigation. They then returned it to me in an even more damaged condition and advised they would be honouring the warranty as their records show it was in working order when it was sent. I literally took this lens out the box and put it on my camera and it broken through no fault of my own. Do not risk buying from them. They cannot be trusted.

They say to come next day because I didn’t have time to wait to them procedure on my time . Also I got many policy’s like trading my time to wait to have my money back .

I am pleased to pass on my thanks and gratitude to Guurpal your Store Manager at CEX WALTHAMSTOW for the impeccable service he provided.
I personally appreciate his hard work, diligence and desire to meet my needs on Saturday 18th August 2018. He was very prompt, professional and able to produce an excellent outcome for me.
I currently work for the NHS but I also have come from a retail background so I know exactly what to expect as a team member as well as a customer. The service Guurpal provides demonstrates that he is always willing to put the customer and their needs at the forefront of his mind. I also monitored his enthusiasm and his ability to motivate his team members as they all behaved considerate and mannerly.
It is not an exaggeration to say that Guurpal should be promoted to Area Manager for his great dedication and admirable work ethics. I am so please to have received such an extraordinary service. I will 1000% come back to shop again with my whole family!
Kind regards,
Chezelle

Brought a Samsung GALAXY S4 for £105 in May 2018, hardly used the phone as it was for work. in August 2018 the phone then stated out of the blue that it had no sim. the sim card was in place and hadn't been touched. I took the phone back to the CEX shop in Guildford Surrey where i purchased it as it had a 24 month warranty. They took the phone and sent me away for 40 minutes while they checked it. When i came back they said the warranty was void as there was a tiny crack in the rear external case of the phone. I explained that this has nothing to do with the Sim card not registering and then they showed me some bent pins where the sim card goes and said that i have bent the pins and that is why it doesn't work. I was furious as i had not bent the pins, I hadn't touched the sim card - why would I? Anyway the store manager basically called me a liar and said the phone will not be covered as it is accidental damage. there is no customer service phone number to contact CEX, i will never use this company again, this is the one and only experience that i have had with them.

Don't be fooled into thinking that you will get decent money for your old Orange phone sending it to CeX. Their website allows you to specify what network the phone is on and I was offered £5-7 for my phones and sent them in.
Tracked my order on line (as they did not e-mail me) to find that the phone values were now 1p as Orange no long exists in UK and so phones graded as Not Working. Complained twice, that online values were not being honoured but got generic answer that totally ignores the point.

My son bought a xbox 1 on 4/8/18 @16.03pm and some games and a lead for box, after taking it home and spending time setting it up it would not work properly so on 10/8/18 he taken it back to the shop and asked for a refund which they refused and said they would test it for 2 days under warranty, when he picked it back up they said nothing wrong with it so he brought it home to find it was still broken and once again they refused him a refund as it was faulty goods, so he asked myself his dad to come with him as he felt the manager was aggressive and intimidating as i am an ex-police officer and used to these situations, Today i taken my son to the shop at approx 10am to gain a refund and i seen what he meant, the manager refused a refund, i quoted consumer act and right to refund under faulty goods..he still refused and got aggressive with me threatening to call the police, so i asked for him to call the police and carried on insisting that he refunds over a period of approx 30 minutes with the customers listening, it was only when i posted on facebook and threatened to put it on spotted and called trading standards that he eventually after a battle agreed, but then he refused to refund the £15 for the lead for the box and 1 hour later he was refusing to refund for the xbox1 game £18! even though it was bought with the console, he offered £9, again i quoted the act to him and threatened small claims court, what a horrendous experience it was and surely are not being legal, i am going to trading standards and spotted in every town and a website, horrendous behaviour!!!! over an hour of stress caused by this so called manager. avoid company at all costs!!
just received a response from them 15/8/18 so basically they do not care at all....so looks like trading standards now and ombudsman.....dreadful company ….run by franchisees who do not care.....following response received.....
Hi Andy,
Thank you for writing back with the details.
With the help of the details you have provided, I was able to locate the store involved in this order.
We aim to always give our customers a pleasant shopping experience, and we hope that their visit can encourage them to positively share their experience with other prospective customers.
I have forwarded a feedback to the store management team so that the necessary training can be given to the staff to avoid these instances in the future. I apologise for the inconvenience caused to you in this matter.
If there is anything else I can help you with, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Regards,
Sumeet

IF I could give no stars I would! Do not I repeat do not order online from this company! I have no choice but to keep ordering until I get a right item as I have a voucher I have to use. I have emailed the managing director directly it’s so appalling and I have had no help for the 3rd time I have had to place an order to get a correct item that works! 1st one cancelled, fair enough, 2nd GoPro wrong one, 3rd one A grade faulty and missing a vital part on camera And so back to local store again for refund!4th told by online service to order again and they would help to ensure what is being sent is correct etc and guess what? Nope they didn’t aNd have dispatched it anywAy! I have lost money in car parks and petrol and time wasted and I have a special needs son who came with me and it upsets him to queue and have to wait for them to check an item I just received in the post by them! I then had to get family help to have my son as he was upset and didn’t want to go! I have no doubt I will be there again to refund my 4th order as it hasn’t been checked! I paid more for an A grade to ensure this didn’t happen but there was no point! No response to messages or emails in time either. No phone number and now I see why! Help my latest order number is 5007769 but I should all too late! Have had it now and wish I never bothered as it’s stressing me out now!

I lost all the data, pictures, videos and work files I had on my phone because the staff member forgot to tell me they wipe phones when checking them. I was not offered any format of genuine apology, the manager didn't even try and attempt to show me how to restore my phone after me repeatedly telling them it wasn't backed up. I am disgusted that they watched me stand there crying over the loss of irreplaceable memories without being able to show any care.

The minecraft special edition console can be produced NEW from most sainsburys /Tesco for £220. My children saved and bought one as they wanted the console but already own the minecraft and the story mode and as clearly stated in the description online. It does not come with the game or DLC's. Fine we thought , £40 saving might come with a couple of scratches on it as its discounted . What isn't made clear is that unless your buy it in MINT CONDITION! There give you any controller! Even a 3rd party! And that the pictures shown don't represent what I'm really buying. The only reason I know this is because I live not to far from a Cex so I emailed them asking them if I could swap the controller I'd reserved for the minecraft and was given a link to there T&C and told no and that I should take it from my kids and return it. They didn't ask what controller I'd been given and if they did they might have released it cost more then the minecraft one I wanted and was expecting when buy. Very disappointed and feel cheated. Will not be using there online service again

I placed an order online with CEX for a £530 MacBook pro on Tuesday evening. Nothing was heard from them apart from the automatically generated email (stating delivery would take place between 3-5 working days) until Thursday. The email stated the item had been dispatched and gave me a UPS tracking number. The tracking number did not work at all and on Friday morning I contacted customer service by email about this issue. I also later contacted them by Facebook messenger as they hadn't responded to my email. It's not possible to phone CEX customer service, only email, Facebook & Twitter and they don't respond quickly to any of those either. I was then informed that the store hadn't shipped my item as reported and they would do so today (Friday). It would definitely go out today. I was given a new tracking number and using this I found that the item hadn't shipped on Friday. Saturday morning I contacted them again. After a long wait I was informed the item now wouldn't ship until Monday. No apologies. The item now won't arrive for a further 5 days, making the total shipping time 10 days! No apologies from anyone. I was just thanked for my understanding. I requested to pick up the item from the store but was told I could not for security reasons. Dont understand what security risks there are if i bring the appropriate ID. So I asked if I could cancel the order, get a refund of my in store voucher and buy one myself from another store. I was told this would take 3 working days to process! Now I am between a rock and a hard place as I have no quick solution to getting my voucher or my laptop. Customer service take ages to respond to communications and are unwilling to do anything quickly to resolve the situation. Contacting CS by electronic means is not acceptable. We really need a phone number to call in situations like this, but CEX don't want to give us one. Terrible service. Avoid buying on line from them at all costs.

bought a second had iphone 6 from a CEX store. I had it for 6 months and then one day it stopped turning on. I took it to the CEX store with all of my receipts and was told they could not try to fix it or refund the warranty because it had been water damaged. While in my possession, the phone never got wet and was not taken into humid areas. I was very careful with the phone because I do not have enough money to purchase another one. I found the absolute refusal of the staff to help as unacceptable, even if the phone had somehow been water damaged it is clear that this did not cause the phone to break. I will never shop here again - I lost over £300.

I bought a 500GB drive and upon trying to use it, Found that it was faulty. When I attempted to review the product on the CEX site, I discovered it was impossible to post my (one star) review. -submission after submission were rejected.
Here are two examples of the submissions that were rejected:-
1.
I don`t recommend this item as it was faulty. The local store confirmed this and issued me with a voucher which I used to buy a larger drive. - REJECTED.
2.
I do not recommend this drive as it did not work at all. - REJECTED
As you can see, there was nothing derogatory or bad about the submissions, I simply posted the truth about my purchase, - (it was faulty).
As you can see, apparently you are not allowed to post negative reviews HOWEVER they are worded.
I can`t recommend (or respect), any company that censors customers opinions in this way, it displays a really negative attitude and disrespect for honesty on CEX`s part.

Never Again - sham warranty
Never Again - I bought a phone - was told I had a 2 year warranty - the phone was faulty after 2 weeks (just got round to using it) - I took it back and they told me that the warranty was invalid because of 'screen bounce' - was purely an excuse to get out of supporting what they had sold me - based on my experience walk on by and dont enter this shop - defintely do not trust their sham warranty - CEX, do the right thing, step up and fix this issue!!

Took in an X-BOX 360 to trade in - before testing the disk drive tray - they deleted EVERYTHING from the memory - THEN told me it had failed as the draw didnt open properly. When I got it home - it seemed fine to me - BUT they had obviously deleted ALL of the saved games and downloaded demos. NOT IMPRESSED.

Fantastic variety of old classics and new films. Great collection of rare box sets. I picked up a rare Saint box set from the 60's. nice Nostalgia trip. Also I will get cash back on it or trade it and get a voucher of considerable worth. I can get more cool stuff.

Exchanged a couple of games for a voucher, as they didn't have the game I wanted in stock.
The voucher didn't work for over 24hrs as the system was down in the store.
When the voucher eventually worked, I placed order on Friday 23/2/17, soon after which I received confirmation that game has been despatched.
Ive been checking the tracking number, and Royal Mail are still expecting it... Royal Mail tracking tells me that the package from CEX was expected at 3:15pm on 23/2/18... 26/2/18, and they're still expecting it..

Bought a phone on the 26th of January 2017 from the Sauchiehall street branch.I had it a week and realised that it was not connecting to a network automatically and I had to manually reconnect to my network.This was no good to me so I bought another phone.I took the phone back to the shop today 17/1/2018 and was told that they would test the phone and could I come back into the store 2 hours later.I went back to the store and was informed that despite them not being able to loose a signal and test what I said was the problem on the phone and that the phone was working fine. I had a verbal exchange with the manageress who instead of listening to reason stated that as she could not lose a signal despite trying 3 different sim cards that the phone was fine and became very aggressive and started swearing and offering me £60 in vouchers instead of £60 in cash which was how I originally paid.The phone was within the 30 day cash back policy and it was faulty so any reasonable person should and would have expected their cash back.What kind of business cannot diagnose a fault,tell you that they cannot diagnose a fault and still deny you your rights? I asked to speak to someone above this very angry young upstart but she point blank refused. I would advise that anyone thinking of buying a phone from this company to really think long and hard about doing it as you will probably end up with a phone that does not work properly and out of pocket !

A few days ago I was looking at webuy.com also known as Cex. I was very interested in a Lenovo A10 all in one computer as I did some research online about this item. I was very happy with the reviews on that computer that reading up on Cex webpage it said very clearly that this computer was graded as a B rating (which from previous purchases from Cex site I know for a fact that their rating system is top notch and second to non). My computer arrived a week later-I was not disappointed at all as there was not even a scratch on it, everything was just like it came off the production line. Yet the only thing which was not to my taste was the keyboard and mouse was a Dell product and not the correct Lenovo items for the computer?. Otherwise the computer was quite fast-a little slow on start up, everything else was first class-well done Cex you have not let me down yet. There is a problem in not being able to talk to the store as you are given just one number to dial? and this will not get you through to them, only in saying that if you want to get in touch with them then you are given an email address where you can email them with whatever your questions are. ( I think this is wrong as sometimes you want to know about a certain product and you want to know what state it is in before purchasing the item) Cex I would give you a 5 star ratting apart from this big problem that you have created for yourselves).

I was sold a used X BOX by this company througb their shop in Marlands centre,southampton.It has a 4 pin code fitted by the previous owner or person unknown and i don't know the code.This makes the X BOX unusable and not fit for purpose.The staff in the shop have decided it is mine,the customers problem and mine alone to correct.No refund,no technical help,just for me to go away and solve it myself.I am and will take action until my money is returned or the problem with the x box corrected.Shoddy is a word that springs to mind.

Unfortunately I am unable to give no star so it will have to be 1 star. As a warning DO NOT buy a mobile phone from this company as the chances are it will have been stolen!. I have experienced this twice now with CeX and on the second occasion they would not refund the full cost I paid for the phone as it was reported 7 months after I had bought it. Therefore they would only refund the market value as per their T&C's, which are completely not relevant as they have sold stolen property. The phone was blocked and was unusable.....not my problem really, no reason why I should lose money just because CeX sold a stolen phone! Just a warning really!!
