@HSBC_UK
 is there an issue with the mobile banking app? Can’t access it following iPhone upgrade 15.1?


I went into my branch, and it was good timing - the new version of the UK app was in the Play store, and it worked! Both on my phone for mobile banking, and to generate a security key for use on my desktop. Phew!


@HSBC_UK
 Since IOS 15 updated last night, my mobile banking app crashes. Is there an update coming?

@HSBC
 mobile banking app, which means you can't access the app OR online banking.

The idea to merge HSBC simply pay app and HSBC India mobile banking app is good. But while making payment from HSBC mobile banking app, there is no requirement to give UPI pin, which is a serious concern. In HSBC Simplypay, pin is must.Request you to address this issue

@HSBC_UK
 The mobile banking app is still not functional on Pixel 6. The last communication on 19th Nov indicated that a fix will be available soon. There is no workaround to access my account. Is this being dealt with as a priority? It's been 3 weeks since it was first reported.


@HSBC_UK
 I can't use the HSBC mobile banking app on my Google Pixel 6....is there a fix coming for this?


Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you have problems with the app. After you have updated your iOS I would suggest going in to the app store and check to see if there is an update for the HSBC UK mobile banking app. ^^Abbas


Yes, but whole point of the mobile app is to do Mobile Banking..... If you really don't have an ETA then I guess time to switch.
