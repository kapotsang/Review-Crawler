Limited functionality
The Outlook side panel in HubSpot has limited functionality, especially when compared with the similar function for the Salesforce side panel. You are not able to directly attach emails to a contact record or associate with an opportunity or other related item.
What problem are you trying to solve?
The Outlook side panel shows information in HubSpot for the client or prospect that is in the relevant email panel.
What do you like?
The relevant CRM contact is highlighted in the side panel
What do you dislike?
Other than providing reference information for the contact, there is not much functionality or interaction that is facilitated by the side panel

Outlook is the worst for syncing up meetings
Really wish Outlook had a way for Teams to connect with HubSpot meetings easily so that I could create meetings in HubSpot and have it sent to the right people and with a team meeting link automatically created. Gmail is so much better with HubSpot, but unfortunately stuck with MS for now.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Emails and calendar.
What do you like?
At least emails are tracked.
What do you dislike?
Scheduling meetings.

Good but not great
Outlook is working ok. On the other hand, (not that you are asking about it) but HubSpot add-on is making Outlook fail sometimes, the sidebar seems to be full of bugs, email texts are appearing behind the sidebar with me not being able to see the rest of the text if not shutting the addon down. Although, this does happen only when my other addon "Grammarly" is enabled".
What problem are you trying to solve?
Mainly communication between colleagues and associates
What do you like?
Sending emails
What do you dislike?
HubSpot asking questions about the use of Outlook.

Wasted 2 Days trying to install HubSpot Office 365 connector
Still not a clean integration to capture emails to prospects. Sometimes it works and other times it doesn't. I have to waste time searching for instruction on how to connect HubSpot to Office 365.

Poor experience with Outlook integration
I have to log in with a security code every single day. It opens in Internet Explorer 11 which is not supported. Your tech people could not fix this.

Sending emails to client records.

Useless - crashes Outlook constantly unless you disable it
How well is Outlook working for you - guess you mean the HubSpot add-in? Not at all - useless, crashes Outlook repeatedly and cannot be used at all. Has to be disabled.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Crazy question - "What are you using Outlook for?" - erm, email.
What do you like?
No Pros
What do you dislike?
All Cons
